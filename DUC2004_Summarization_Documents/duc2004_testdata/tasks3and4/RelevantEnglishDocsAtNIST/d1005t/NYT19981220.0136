 Clinton's strategy for survival depends on the differences 
between the Senate and the House, differences intended by the framers 
of the Constitution and at least as evident today as they were when 
the Senate acquitted President Andrew Johnson in 1868. The constitutional 
difference is obvious. In terms of impeachment, on Saturday it took 
a simple majority of the House to impeach, but it will take a two-thirds 
majority of the Senate to convict if the trial goes to a verdict. 
The 67-vote requirement, in a Senate with only 55 Republicans, invites 
the censure solution so devoutly desired by the White House. But the 
political differences are as important. The Senate's considerable 
sense of self-importance and dignity makes many members fear a trial 
that would have to deal with the physical details of Clinton's affair 
with Monica Lewinsky. And the negotiating process needed to agree 
on something murkier than ``guilty'' or ``not guilty'' is at home 
in the Senate. Its rules emphasize the rights of individual senators 
and invite compromise. Effective leadership there is the art of herding 
cats. Senators who get things done make deals across party lines to 
succeed. In the House, majority parties bully those in the minority. 
Senators also have to represent constituents of the other party; in 
the House, partisan gerrymandering has made it possible to play to 
only one side. But there was an air in Washington _ as in the nation 
_ that something had gone off the rails this weekend. With articles 
of impeachment voted by scant partisan margins, 228 to 206 and 221 
to 212, it seemed like a European parliament in a crisis. Democrats 
accused the House Republican majority of a naked political power play 
to undo the election of a president they despised. Republicans insisted 
that that was nonsense, that if Clinton was removed from office by 
the Senate they would just be left with another Democrat, Al Gore, 
as president. And Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, a reluctant vote for impeachment, 
said on Sunday that most Republicans assumed that if Clinton was ousted, 
the Democrats ``would be dramatically benefited.'' But if they were 
not making political calculations _ and there is little evidence that 
most Republicans did not take their responsibility seriously _ the 
House may reflect something at least as bad as naked ambition. Maybe 
worse. Instead, the House that was displayed to the nation on Saturday 
seemed to represent an extreme level of disagreement. To one faction, 
it was obvious that the president had committed perjury and obstructed 
justice, and no less transparent that these were offenses requiring 
his impeachment, trial and removal from office. To the other, the 
offenses may have seemed likely, if not proven, but the crimes fell 
well short of the standard needed for impeachment. When only 17 representatives, 
12 Republicans and 5 Democrats, dissented from the party line as they 
did on the charge of obstruction of justice, these differing views 
reflect the fundamental partisanship of the House, gone to extreme. 
Professor Ross K. Baker of Rutgers University called Saturday's votes 
``an authentic expression of the polarization of the congressional 
districts.'' He added, ``Both parties have been driven down to their 
base, their most passionate, most committed, most zealous voters.'' 
This House seems as though it cannot talk to itself, like a parliament 
in a country with two official languages but no functioning simultaneous 
translation system. For outsiders who try to translate, the fervent 
serial speechmaking left the utterly political interpretation as the 
easiest analysis. But plainly one underlying difference was that Republicans 
were more upset by the moral and character issues that underlay the 
accusation of perjury than were Democrats. And Democrats, who succeeded 
Republicans as the suspicious, oppressed minority after the 1994 midterm 
elections, were more upset than were Republicans by the methods of 
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and the House Judiciary Committee, 
which accepted his evidence and interpretation unquestioningly. Those 
same general inclinations will show in the Senate, though probably 
not as dramatically. The Senate is indeed more partisan than it used 
to be. As minority leader in 1993, Bob Dole vowed to block Clinton 
from passing almost anything that his party could filibuster. Sen. 
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat who is the minority leader 
today, has profited from Dole's example. And when House Republicans 
who learned congressional obstructionism at the feet of Newt Gingrich 
have gotten elected to the Senate, they have changed it a bit. Still, 
the Senate seems to change them more. Even Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, 
perhaps the most strident representative to come to the Senate in 
recent years, seems to be mellowing as his Senate tenure grows. George 
Washington, who attended the Constitutional Convention, is said to 
have explained the purpose of the Senate, indirectly elected to six-year 
terms, to Thomas Jefferson, who did not attend, in this fashion: Saying 
the point was to have one more deliberative body than a House elected 
by the people every two years, Washington he said, ``We pour legislation 
into the Senate saucer to cool it.'' That difference worked for Andrew 
Johnson in 1868, when the Senate waded through a long trial and heard 
evidence and acquitted him after the House, in a fit of partisan passion 
over Reconstruction, had voted impeachment.
