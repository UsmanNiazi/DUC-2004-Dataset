y throngs of schoolchildren but ignored by most Gazans who 
went about their daily routines, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
returned here Wednesday to promote his accord with Israel to a wary 
public. The reception for Arafat was orchestrated by his Al Fatah 
movement and the Palestinian Authority, and had none of the euphoric 
spontaneity of the mass celebrations that followed previous Israeli-Palestinian 
agreements. Wearied by 19 months of bitter stalemate with Israel and 
by steadily worsening economic hardship, most people in Gaza seemed 
indifferent to Arafat's return, unwilling yet to set aside deep suspicions 
that the promise of the latest accord may also go unrealized. ``The 
accord is good, but the important thing is implementation,'' said 
Nasser Qassas, a truck driver, as he sat on a street corner far away 
from the festivities. Immediately after signing the accord Arafat 
toured some of the region's Arab capitals to drum up support for it. 
Wednesday, as Arafat arrived at his beachfront office, there were 
marching bands, hundreds of flag-waving pupils, and the obligatory 
red carpet, honor guard and a long line of officials from the Palestinian 
Authority. Banners strung over the road greeted Arafat as the ``Maker 
of Victory and Peace,'' the ``Faithful Guardian of the Palestinian 
Dream'' who had brought ``New Hope for the Masses of Our People.'' 
Stepping out of his car and flashing his trademark V-sign _ for victory 
_ Arafat confidently predicted that the accord signed with the Israelis 
in Washington last Friday would proceed according to plan, despite 
a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to postpone ratification 
of the accord by the Israeli Cabinet. ``What has been signed will 
be implemented accurately,'' Arafat told reporters. To his people, 
he repeated what has become a familiar mantra: ``Onward together until 
we pray together in Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian state.'' 
But Arafat has a difficult road ahead. He must persuade a deeply skeptical 
public that this time the agreement with Israel will yield tangible 
benefits. The campaign has already begun, with the Palestinian radio 
and press trumpeting gains of the accord: an airport, travel between 
the West Bank and Gaza, and prisoner releases. Nabil Shaath, the irrepressibly 
optimistic minister of planning in the Palestinian cabinet, spoke 
glowingly of the prospects ahead in a recent interview on the Voice 
of Palestine radio. He described trips from the West Bank to eat fish 
by the Gaza sea, and travel from a Palestinian international airport 
where there is no visible Israeli presence. ``Patience, and slowly 
everything will fall into place,'' he assured his listeners. On the 
security front, Arafat will have to move decisively against armed 
elements without provoking civil strife. Trouble is already brewing 
in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where Arafat's police officers 
killed a local youth this week during a demonstration against a weapons 
search in the local Al Fatah headquarters. Angry Fatah leaders held 
demonstrations and strikes in several West Bank towns, prompting Arafat 
to move swiftly to defuse the crisis. The four officers who conducted 
the search were jailed after quick trials, an investigation of the 
shooting was begun, and the victim was given a state funeral Wednesday, 
attended by top officials and police officers. In Gaza, where Palestinians 
are bottled up in an impoverished strip of land surrounded by an Israeli 
security fence and border checkpoints, there is great yearning for 
a measure of freedom that could result from the latest accord. Qassas, 
the truck driver, said he was most eager for the opening of safe passage 
routes between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. ``It'll provide emotional 
relief, and material benefits, because I'll be able to make delivery 
runs to the West Bank,'' he said. ``I'll get a breath of fresh air 
and see the mountains, relax and meet other people. I'll feel freer.'' 
Khaled Shaghub, a laborer, said he had not seen relatives in the West 
Bank for five years because of Israeli border closures that have prevented 
him from leaving the Gaza Strip. ``We're in a big prison now,'' he 
said. ``If the agreement is carried out it will change people's mentality. 
We will feel the beginnings of a real peace.''
