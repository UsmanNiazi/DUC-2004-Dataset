ister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Monday to walk away from 
the Mideast peace agreements if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally 
declares statehood in May. Netanyahu's warning came a day after Arafat 
said in Washington that ``I hope that this (coming) year will be the 
year of the independent Palestinian state.'' Palestinian negotiator 
Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians are paying no heed to Netanyahu's 
threats. ``Let him shout as much as he pleases,'' Asfour said of the 
Israeli leader. The Palestinians say the peace agreements between 
Israel and the Palestinians do not prevent Arafat from declaring statehood 
on May 4, 1999, the day the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ends. The new acrimony came just a 
little over a week after the implementation of stage one of the land-for-security 
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the plan, Israel 
is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, 
in exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic militants. As 
part of the accord, Israel also agreed to free 750 Palestinian prisoners. 
In the first stage, Israel released 250, most of them criminals, prompting 
Palestinian complaints that the agreement was breached. The Palestinians 
demand that Israel free political activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli 
activities. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, flew Monday 
to Washington to raise the issue with Clinton administration officials. 
``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for American intervention,'' 
Erekat said Sunday. Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult 
to continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said. However, 
Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free murderers. 
I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he told Israel 
radio. Israel holds about 2,500 prisoners. Popular pressure on Arafat 
has grown, with prisoners' relatives demonstrating daily against the 
Palestinian Authority and accusing it of abandoning the prisoners. 
Netanyahu, meanwhile, described Arafat's latest remarks concerning 
statehood as a ``a gross violation'' of the Oslo accords. Netanyahu's 
office issued a statement saying that if Arafat declares a state ``this 
will mean the collapse of the Oslo agreements.'' Netanyahu has warned 
that he would respond by annexing parts of the West Bank. On Monday, 
Netanyahu did not make specific threats, saying only that ``we can 
do a great deal.'' He said he would raise the issue when his Cabinet 
meets again to consider the next stage of the Wye River peace accord. 
In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign Minister 
Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an additional 
Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians. Israel's Cabinet has 
already decided that it would hand over only an additional 1 percent 
of the West Bank in an upcoming troop withdrawal. By naming junior 
officials without a mandate, Israel apparently was sending a message 
to the Palestinians that they would not receive more than the 1 percent 
already decided on. Asfour said Israel was humiliating the Palestinians 
by making such appointments. ``This is just another example of Israel's 
lack of seriousness in implementing the agreement,'' he said. The 
Palestinian team to the talks is headed by Erekat.
