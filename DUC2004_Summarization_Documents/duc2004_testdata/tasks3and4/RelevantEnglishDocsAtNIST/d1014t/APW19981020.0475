-hand man to outgoing Algerian President Liamine Zeroual 
may have quit the government, but he'll still be involved in the upcoming 
presidential election, one of his newspapers said Tuesday. Mohamed 
Betchine, a retired general who had been seen as a possible candidate 
to succeed Zeroual, resigned Monday amid press reports accusing him 
of corruption and torture. Defended by Zeroual to the end, Betchine 
had called the charges part of a smear campaign amid an apparent power 
struggle within the military-backed government of this petroleum-rich 
North African nation. Betchine ``must continue to play his political 
role,'' said a commentary in the daily l'Authentique, part of his 
newspaper group. In accepting Betchine's resignation, Zeroual merely 
``decided to give him back his freedom.'' The newspaper did not specify 
exactly what role Betchine would play. Zeroual, also a retired general, 
last month announced he would cut short his five-year presidential 
term, holding early elections before the end of February. His term 
was to end in the year 2000. Officials have since said the election 
may take place in March. Zeroual had drawn opposition from hardliners 
who opposed his past contacts with Islamic militants. The insurgency 
that is in its seventh year has left an estimated 75,000 people dead. 
Betchine's resignation came a day after Justice Minister Mohamed Adami, 
also caught up in controversy, announced his resignation. Some newspapers 
have charged that Adami had sexual relations with prisoners and prostitutes. 
Both Betchine and Adami are leading members of the National Democratic 
Rally party, considered Zeroual's party. The pro-government El Moudjahid 
said that ``no longer held by his obligations of reserve, he can contribute 
to a high-level debate on the great preoccupations of Algerian society 
and that which really blocks it.'' The independent newspapers El Watan 
and Le Matin accused Betchine of embezzling two Italian lines of credit 
and of being responsible for torture while security chief during riots 
in October 1988. The dailies are among five who the state-owned printing 
plants stopped servicing since Saturday. Officials say it was due 
to back payments since 1996, but the newspapers allege the timing 
was politically motivated. As a result, most independent newspapers 
have suspended printing in a sign of solidarity.
