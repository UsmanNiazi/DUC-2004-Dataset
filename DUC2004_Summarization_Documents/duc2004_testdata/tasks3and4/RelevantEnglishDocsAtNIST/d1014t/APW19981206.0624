litants slashed the throats of seven people in a mountain 
town overnight, authorities said Sunday, raising to 52 the death toll 
from the latest wave of violence. But Algeria's embattled prime minister, 
in a televised state-of-the-nation address before Parliament, insisted 
the nearly 7-year-old insurgency was under control and that his painful 
economic reforms were making progress. The victims were killed ``with 
savagery'' Saturday night in the town of Merad, near Tipaza, 100 kms 
(60 miles) west of the capital, a brief government statement said. 
Hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the militants 
slashed the seven to death, and they shot and wounded five people 
who tried to flee. The deaths were part of the latest round of attacks 
by militants that began last Wednesday, in a nearly 7-year-old insurgency 
against the military-backed government. More than 75,000 people have 
died. Barely two weeks before the holy month of Ramadan _ a characteristically 
bloody period during the insurgency _ the violence also preceded the 
speech Sunday afternoon by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia. In his two-hour 
talk, Ouyahia argued the country's security situation ``is constantly 
improving.'' He has drawn derision for insisting the insurgency was 
only ``residual terrorism.'' But Ouyahia also told the lawmakers of 
the need for ``vigilance and mobilization.'' Ouyahia, in power since 
January 1996, did not mention his expected departure from office ahead 
of an early presidential election slated for April. But an official 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prime minister 
was likely to announce his resignation Thursday. Ouyahia is seen as 
a potential candidate for the election President Liamine Zeroual announced 
Sept. 11. Zeroual is not running. Sen. Smail Hamdani, a former ambassador 
to France considered a technocrat without strong party links, was 
expected to be appointed caretaker prime minister as early as next 
Saturday. Ouyahia pledged government help for terror victims and for 
families demanding information on their missing loved ones arrested 
by security forces. On the economic front, Ouyahia said that through 
an austerity plan the government cut inflation from 29.7 percent in 
1995 to 5 percent his year. Despite a wave of strikes, Ouyahia defended 
``the necessity to liberalize the country's economy'' and to do away 
with ``the aid-dependent mentality.'' He said his government has refused 
an offer by the International Monetary Fund to again reschedule the 
country's 30 billion foreign debt. Ouyahia has been plagued by strikes 
protesting the military-backed government's efforts to cut subsidies 
and bailouts of a mostly state-owned economy, allowing some companies 
to fail. The restructuring _ forced by falling world petroleum prices 
and foreign debt payments _ has thrown thousands more out of work, 
compounding unemployment that officially is 30 percent. Independent 
estimates put the figure much higher. ``The unemployment and misery 
that drive people to violence, to prostitution and suicide are for 
Mr. Ouyahia but a state of mind,'' said Salah Makhlouf, a restaurant 
manager watching Ouyahia's speech on TV. The insurgency broke out 
in the former French colony after the government canceled January 
1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
