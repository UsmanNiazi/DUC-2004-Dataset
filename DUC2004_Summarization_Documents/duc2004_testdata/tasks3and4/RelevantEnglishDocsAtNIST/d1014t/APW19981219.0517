 new Prime Minister announced the composition of his Cabinet 
on Saturday, and it looks a lot like the previous government. The 
program of the new government is expected to be presented before the 
Algerian parliament in less than a week. President Liamine Zeroual 
will keep control of the Defense Ministry, and Ahmed Attaf also remains 
Foreign Minister in the new government. Prime Minister Smail Hamdani, 
a former diplomat, announced that the new Interior Minister would 
be Abdelmalek Sella, a former ambassador and specialist in security 
issues. He replaces Mustapha Benmansour, who was accused of electoral 
fraud. The new Justice Minister will be Ahmed Noui, who replaces Mohamed 
Adami, while the Finance Minister remains Abdelkrim Harchaoui. Hamdani 
was named Prime Minister after the widely unpopular Ahmed Ouyahia 
resigned from the post earlier this month. The new government will 
be responsible for preparing early presidential elections, which Zeroual 
has called for April. Preparations for an Organization of African 
Unity summit in Algiers in May or June also should fall upon his government. 
Zeroual, whose five-year term ends in 2000, announced in September 
plans to step down early. Ouyahia, who served as prime minister for 
three years, has been roundly criticized for fraud in November 1997 
local elections, failing to improve the economy or end a Muslim insurgency. 
An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in violence since the 
start of the insurgency in 1992, triggered by the army's decision 
to cancel legislative elections a Muslim fundamentalist party was 
on the verge of winning.
