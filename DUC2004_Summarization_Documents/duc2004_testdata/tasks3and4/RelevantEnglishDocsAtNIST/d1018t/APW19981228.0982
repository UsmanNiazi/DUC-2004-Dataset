ilitants kidnapped 16 Western tourists in southern Yemen 
Monday, including 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians, security 
officials said. They said the kidnappers, who belong to the Islamic 
Jihad extremist group, were demanding the release of their leader 
Saleh Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested by Yemeni authorities two 
weeks ago. Tribal leaders said about 10 gunmen ambushed a convoy of 
five vehicles carrying a group of 17 tourists traveling near the southern 
town of Mawdiyah, in the Abyan province. They opened fire on a number 
of policemen escorting the tourists. No one was injured in the firefight, 
but the group's British tour leader and a Yemeni guide managed to 
escape, said the tribal leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The remaining 16 tourists were abducted and driven to an unknown destination 
in Abyan province, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital, 
San`a. The British tourists included six women and six men. The remaining 
tourists were two American women and two Australian men. Security 
officials in Abyan, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
al-Atwi's arrest was part of a crackdown on Islamic extremists who 
had taken the law into their hands by enforcing strict Islamic rules 
on the population of southern Yemen. They said vigilantes belonging 
to the group flogged men for selling and drinking alcohol _ which 
is forbidden in Islam _ and women for ignoring the Islamic dress code. 
The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a military 
camp in southern Yemen, said the officials. The kidnappers are also 
demanding the release of another of their leader who is also in jail. 
The security sources did not identify the second leader. Britain's 
Press Association said the tourists were traveling with the British 
tour company Explore in conjunction with a local operator in San`a. 
``The British tourists are all young but I cannot say any more,'' 
PA quoted the operator, Yahya al-Haifi, as saying. In London, a Foreign 
Office spokesman said Britain was in touch with Yemeni authorities. 
``We have made it clear that our top priority is the safe and swift 
return of the hostages,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. 
The Foreign Office advised British nationals traveling to Yemen should 
``keep in touch with developments'' during their stay. Monday's abduction 
brings to 20 the total number of Westerners held hostage in Yemen. 
Members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe are holding four Germans _ three 
women and one man _ in the province of Marib, 170 kilometers (105 
miles) northeast of San`a. The tribesmen are pressing the government 
to provide more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads. The 
Germans were seized on Dec. 7.
