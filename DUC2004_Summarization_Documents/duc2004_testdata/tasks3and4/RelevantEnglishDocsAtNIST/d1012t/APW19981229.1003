King Hussein has been discharged from an American hospital 
after treatment for cancer, his brother Crown Prince Hassan said Tuesday. 
Hussein, 63, will spend ``a few days'' of convalescence at his summer 
residence in suburban Maryland and then fly to London for more rest 
before returning home, added the prince. ``I break to you the joyous 
news that his majesty, ... my dear and beloved brother, has fully 
recovered from his illness,'' Hassan said in a televised speech. The 
king was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota, on July 
13 with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He underwent six rounds of chemotherapy. 
Mayo Clinic spokeswoman Jane Jacobs said that Hussein was discharged 
Tuesday morning. The 51-year-old Hassan quoted a royal message from 
Hussein as saying stopovers in Maryland and London were essential 
to ``regaining my normal strength.'' The five-minute speech by Hassan, 
who has been acting as regent during his brother's absence, was aimed 
at calming fears among Jordanians about a king battling cancer for 
the second time in six years. Hussein has ruled for 46 years, making 
him the longest reigning Arab ruler. It was not clear exactly when 
Hussein will return. However, officials say he is expected home by 
the Muslim holiday in mid-January that marks the end of the fasting 
month of Ramadan. Hassan quoted Hussein as saying he would return 
to the United States in March for a medical checkup.
