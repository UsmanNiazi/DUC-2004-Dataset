ein said Friday he may return home in early January after 
a sixth and final round of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. It was 
the first time Jordanians had heard of a return date for Hussein, 
63, who has been in the United States since July 13 to receive treatment 
for a non-Hodgkins lymphoma. ``I expect I will return to my beloved 
home either in late December or early January,'' the king said in 
a letter to Zeid Rifai, speaker of the Upper House of Parliament or 
senate. Last week the king assured his countrymen that five rounds 
of chemotherapy at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, have completely 
cured him. But he said he would undergo a marrow transplant in late 
November to ensure that the cancer will not recur. In his letter to 
Rifai, which was carried by the state-run Petra News Agency, Hussein 
said the operation would be carried out next week. The king said that 
during the transplant, he would be confined to bed and ``not allowed 
to receive visitors because of the diminished immunity level as result 
of chemical treatment.'' Petra said the letter was in response to 
affirmations of loyalty expressed by both houses of Parliament last 
week _ a constitutional formality if the king is out of the country 
for more than four months. It is the first time the king has been 
absent for so long since he ascended to the throne at the age of 17 
in 1953.
