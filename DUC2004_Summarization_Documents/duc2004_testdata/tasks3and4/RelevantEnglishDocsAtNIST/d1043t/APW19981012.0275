d States is trying to increase tension between Iran and its 
Arab neighbors in the Gulf, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted 
as saying Monday. The spokesman, Mahmoud Mohammadi, was reacting to 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen's comments that it was imperative 
for American allies in the Gulf to acquire missile defense systems 
to counter weapons in the hands of Iran and Iraq. ``Washington, following 
its backward policies, is trying to foment tension in the region now 
that suitable grounds have been established for cooperation among 
the Islamic nations of the region,'' Iran News quoted Mohammadi as 
saying. An Iraqi newspaper also criticized Cohen's comments. ``We 
find the American defense minister in a new tour in the region coming 
out with silly, unexplained and strange threats,'' said Al-Thawra, 
the newspaper of Iraq's ruling party. Cohen told reporters Saturday 
in Bahrain that the United States would share its missile technology 
with Gulf allies because of the proliferation of missile technology 
in the Gulf. The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently 
tested a long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region. 
Cohen said Iraq, which has been under U.N. sanctions since 1990, continues 
efforts to acquire missile technology that would give weapons a longer 
range than they are permitted to have. Cohen was in Bahrain as part 
of a six-nation Gulf tour, which includes the United Arab Emirates, 
Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
