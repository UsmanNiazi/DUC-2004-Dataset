resident Hosni Mubarak has written to Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein on Iraq's latest dispute with the United Nations, Egypt's 
foreign minister said Wednesday. He did not reveal the contents of 
the letter but said any solution should take into consideration ``the 
interests of the Iraqi people and Iraq's respect of the (U.N.) Security 
Council's resolutions.'' Minister Amr Moussa said he met with Iraq's 
envoy to the Arab League, Nabil Najim, on Monday and also spoke on 
telephone with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Egypt's Middle 
East News Agency said Najim left Cairo Tuesday for Iraq after completing 
his tenure in office. Najim is believed to have carried Mubarak's 
letter. Moussa said he expected Mubarak to hold ``an important discussions'' 
with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen who arrives here Thursday. 
Cohen is touring the Gulf and some Middle East countries to win support 
for possible military action against Iraq. The U.N.-Iraq crisis is 
over Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with U.N. disarmament 
experts. Iraq has demanded a firm timetable for lifting of U.N. sanctions 
as a precondition for resuming cooperation. The sanctions, imposed 
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, will not be lifted until 
the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of mass destruction 
weapons.
