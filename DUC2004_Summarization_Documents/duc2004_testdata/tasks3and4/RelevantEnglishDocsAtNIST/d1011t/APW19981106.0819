of Egypt's Coptic Christians said Friday that police had 
committed ``some transgressions'' against his community, but accused 
foreign media of exaggerating them. Pope Shenouda III described the 
murder of two Copts in a southern farming town in September as a ``normal 
case.'' Egyptian human rights groups have condemned the police investigation 
into the murder in el-Kusheh, 400 kilometers (245 miles) south of 
Cairo. The groups allege that police detained about 1,200 Christians 
and tortured scores of them. The groups suggest that police sought 
to find a Christian culprit to avoid tension between the town's Christian 
majority and Muslim minority. The police's conduct was criticized 
by two local Christian clerics and received widespread publicity in 
the foreign media. A British Sunday newspaper accused police officers 
of conducting a crackdown on the town's Copts and of crucifying and 
raping individuals. An Associated Press correspondent interviewed 
residents of el-Kusheh who displayed scars of what they said was electric 
shock torture on their ears, abdomen and genitals. In his first comments 
on the affair, Shenouda said ``some transgressions by police took 
place during the investigation of this murder.'' Shenouda rarely criticizes 
state policy. His statement, issued to Egypt's official Middle East 
News Agency, did not elaborate on the transgressions. ``The recent 
reports in some foreign media concerning the incidents of the el-Kusheh 
village were exaggerated and did damage to Egypt's reputation. We 
do not accept this,'' the pope said. Rights groups have said that 
the police's conduct did not amount to a government crackdown on Copts, 
but was rather an instance of common police brutality. Government 
officials have repeatedly denied that torture took place and said 
only a few people were arrested. But Osama al-Baz, an adviser to President 
Hosni Mubarak, has been quoted in the opposition Al-Ahali newspaper 
as admitting there were ``transgressions.'' Police said Thursday they 
were conducting an inquiry into the affair and that four officers 
in el-Kusheh had been transferred to another town to ensure that the 
investigation was fair. Some 2,000 Egyptian Christians issued a statement 
Thursday denying that their community was mistreated.
