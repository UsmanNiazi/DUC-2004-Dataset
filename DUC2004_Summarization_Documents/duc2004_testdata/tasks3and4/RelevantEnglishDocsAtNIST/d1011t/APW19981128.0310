an human rights group said Saturday it will give back a dlrs 
25,000 donation from the British Parliament, after a newspaper alleged 
it was payment for falsely reporting about police brutality on Christians. 
The Egyptian Organization of Human Rights has also decided to reject 
all foreign donations, either from governments or voluntary agencies, 
Mahmoud Qandiel, a lawyer with the group, told The Associated Press. 
He said the British Parliament's Human Rights committee had sent the 
check in October as a second payment subsidizing a two-year women's 
legal aid program. The check will soon be returned to the British 
Embassy as proof of EOHR's neutrality, he said. A furor was sparked 
after the EOHR reported that police rounded up hundreds of Copts in 
the southern town of el-Kusheh in August and beat them in a bid to 
extract false confessions in the investigation of a murder of two 
Coptic Christians. The report said police feared the culprits were 
Muslim and were anxious to pin the blame on Christians to prevent 
religious strife in the Christian majority town. During interviews 
with The Associated Press, many villagers confirmed they were tortured. 
The government denied widespread torture in el-Kusheh and said only 
14 people were detained. The Interior Ministry says foreign-funded 
rights groups are maligning Egypt. Besides Britain, EOHR gets donations 
from organizations such as the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, 
the European Fund for Human Rights, the Swedish Church Mission and 
Oxfam. ``Organizations like EOHR do very good work here (in Egypt) 
and that is why we support them,'' British Embassy spokesman Ed Webb 
said. Qandiel said the decision to return the money was taken by EOHR's 
15-member board, which met Thursday to discuss the accusations by 
an independent weekly newspaper, Al-Osboa. ``Dlrs 25,000 for treason,'' 
said a front page headline in its Nov. 23 edition. Calling it a ``flagrant 
conspiracy on Egyptian national security,'' Al-Osboa said EOHR took 
the money ``in return for a fabricated report (about) persecution 
during the el-Kusheh village incidents.'' Two days later, Prosecutor 
General Raga el-Araby launched an investigation and questioned the 
paper's chief editor, Mustafa Bakry, who is believed to have close 
links with Interior Ministry officials. Qandiel said the prosecutor 
is expected to question the EOHR soon, but no date was set yet. He 
said rejecting foreign donations will severely hamper EOHR's work 
since local donations are scarce.
