, United Arab Emirates (AP) - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan said Monday he had urged direct talks between Iran and the United 
Arab Emirates to resolve a dispute over three Gulf islands. Annan, 
speaking at a news conference after the opening of a summit of six 
Gulf Arab leaders, said he had made the suggestion here to the Emirates 
president, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. He said he also telephoned 
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in Tehran. ``I proposed to 
his highness Sheik Zayed that it would be helpful if his country got 
together with Iran for talks on the islands issue,'' Annan said. ``I 
also spoke to the Iranian foreign minister and urged him to engage 
the Emirates as quick as he can,'' Annan added. ``His response was 
positive.'' Iran annexed the three Gulf islands _ Abu Musa and the 
Greater and Lesser Tunbs _ in 1992. The strategic islands, also claimed 
by the Emirates, have been a stumbling block in relations between 
Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The political, economic and 
defense alliance groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar 
and the Emirates. Iran has insisted on direct talks to resolve the 
dispute, but the Emirates has called for international arbitration.
