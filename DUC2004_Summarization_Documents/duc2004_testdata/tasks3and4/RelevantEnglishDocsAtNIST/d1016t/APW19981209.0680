rs of six Gulf Arab states wound up a summit Wednesday with 
a decision to extend until the end of next year cuts in oil production 
that were to end in June. The Gulf Cooperation Council states ``agreed 
to extend their pledged cuts until the end of 1999. At the same time, 
they urged other producers to take similar steps to achieve market 
stability for the benefit of producers and consumers,'' said a communique 
released at the close of the three-day summit. Members of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers outside the cartel 
agreed last June to withdraw 3.1 million barrels a day from the market 
for one year. OPEC's share of that was 2.6 million barrels per day. 
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the 
United Arab Emirates. They together control half the world's proven 
reserves of oil. All but Oman and Bahrain are OPEC members. The summit 
has been overshadowed by record-low oil prices that have hit the economies 
of the Gulf Arab countries hard. The GCC states depend on oil exports 
for 75 percent of their revenue. While the national leaders and oil 
ministers decided to extend the existing production cuts to December 
1999, they decided not to reduce output further. They were not convinced 
that deeper cuts would shore up the market, a Gulf official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. However, their decision could 
be reviewed at the next OPEC meeting in March if oil prices continue 
their downward slide, the official said. Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general 
of the GCC, said Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was 
to blame for the price slump. Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting 
Corp., an Arabic TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused 
by countries not sticking to their production quotas. Analysts say 
Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main over-producers. 
``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to keep 
a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of abiding 
by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said. He denied 
that GCC oil ministers had agreed to reduce production. Officials 
at the summit had earlier made such a claim to The Associated Press, 
adding that the GCC ministers also agreed to ask other producers inside 
and outside OPEC to join them in the cuts, starting in March. Shortly 
before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts for Brent 
crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 
9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London. Gulf 
oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North Sea's Brent 
_ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel as recently 
as 1997. At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's 
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and 
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their belts. 
He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting up 
a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years. The 
summit's final communique said an agreement on the customs union has 
to be drawn up by 1999 and implemented in the year 2001. The union, 
the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite for free trade 
deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's main trading partner, 
the European Union. The final communique called on Iraq to abide by 
all U.N. Security Council resolutions and to admit that its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait was a mistake. The resolution also urged Iran to work for 
a peaceful settlement of a territorial dispute with the Emirates, 
said the officials. Both states claim Abu Musa and the Greater and 
Lesser Tunbs, three tiny islands that Iran annexed in 1992.
