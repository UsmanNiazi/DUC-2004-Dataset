umblings that he is on the verge of defecting, the half-brother 
of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Barzan el-Takriti, who is an 
envoy in Geneva, has sidestepped the question. Takriti, the former 
head of Iraqi intelligence who has spent nearly a decade as delegate 
to the U.N's Geneva headquarters, became the focus of speculation 
when his name surfaced in a routine recall of Iraqi diplomats in July. 
Takriti is no ordinary envoy, however. His duties have far transcended 
normal diplomatic functions. He has dabbled in the world of clandestine 
missions and managed some of the billions Iraq has stashed away. The 
other recalled diplomats are gone, and Takriti has been replaced in 
his U.N. position. He has said he plans to return to Iraq, but not 
immediately. There were hints from associates that he might seek to 
become a ``guest'' in an Arab country, Morocco or the United Arab 
Emirates, thus neither breaking with Iraq nor defecting to the West. 
The most recent defection in the Iraqi ruling family was the flight 
to Jordan of two of Saddam's sons-in-law and their families in 1995. 
They fled with secret documents on Iraq's weapons programs and millions 
of dollars. Upon their return six months later, they were assassinated. 
From Takriti's point of view, there are reasons to stay away, among 
them his wife's chemotherapy in the United States and Switzerland 
for cancer. And he has had a falling out with Saddam's powerful son, 
Uday. Takriti has criticized the president's favored son openly in 
interviews. Uday Hussein, who directed the assassination of the sons-in-law 
barely two days after they came home, was briefly married to Takriti's 
daughter. In interviews, Takriti has called for greater openness and 
less family rule in Iraq, suggestions that did not sit well with Saddam 
or the cousins and nephews who occupy all important positions in the 
ruling hierarchy. Arab diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, 
say recent events are setting the scene for another palace intrigue 
in Baghdad. Takriti said in an interview in the Saudi daily Asharq 
Al Awsat, published on Oct. 12, that he had no reason to defect, but 
stopped short of saying he was going directly home. ``Yes, I am returning 
to Baghdad, and yes I am staying here because of my special circumstances,'' 
he told the Arabic newspaper, which is based in London. ``No, I am 
not quitting politics, and I am not seeking asylum elsewhere.'' He 
said he would have ``preferred'' to put off his return to Baghdad 
for another year until his wife completed her treatment, but pointedly 
said he did not contact Saddam about the matter. ``My brother has 
not interfered because he is a president, and it is not his habit 
to interfere in favor of anyone, no matter how close to him, unless 
he is persuaded that such an interference would lift an injustice 
and is in the interest of the state,'' Takriti told the newspaper. 
The recall was ``just a matter of an ambassador whose time of service 
in one place has ended and who must move to another spot,'' he said. 
``It is not an issue that merits all this attention.'' Knowledgeable 
Iraqi officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, asserted 
that Takriti would not defect, particularly since the last defection 
drew no honorable offers of asylum in the West. Saddam has not pushed 
harder to get him home for fear of provoking a defection, Iraqi affairs 
experts say. In the Swiss capital, Bern, Vera Britsch, speaking for 
the Federal Office for Refugees, said no request for asylum had been 
received from Takriti, which means that he will have to leave the 
country by the end of November. In the last two months, he has moved 
out of his plush quarters and is said to be living in a house he bought 
near Lausanne. A close friend of Takriti's who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said last week that the former special envoy was ``bargaining'' 
over the conditions of his return, seeking some iron-clad assurances 
that he will remain a special envoy. Takriti said in the Oct. 12 article: 
``Who said that this role is not ongoing? Who said the president does 
not assign such missions or that I am not in fact doing this at the 
moment.''
