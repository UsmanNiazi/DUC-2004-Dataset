of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's half-brother has died in 
Switzerland, officials said Monday. The cause of death was not clear, 
but the woman, Ahlam al-Tikriti, had reportedly been under treatment 
for breast cancer. She was 44. A death notice for her appeared in 
the Monday edition of the London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi. 
It was signed by her husband, Barzan al-Tikriti. An Iraqi Embassy 
official said he was told she died last week. A hospital spokeswoman 
confirmed that Mrs. al-Tikriti had died, but declined to give the 
cause or say when. The death is expected to complicate the situation 
of her husband, who earlier this year was ordered to return to Baghdad 
in a shakeup of diplomatic posts. He reportedly has cited his wife's 
illness as his reason for staying in Geneva, against Saddam's orders. 
Al-Tikriti, 46, headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations in Geneva 
for 10 years. He was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats 
recalled to Baghdad. Mrs. al-Tikriti was also the half-sister of Saddam's 
first wife, Sajida, who is the mother of Saddam's two grown sons, 
Odai and Qusai. Mrs. al-Tikriti's daughter, Saja, was divorced from 
Odai in 1995 after complaining she was beaten. The divorce sparked 
a sharp division in the family, which worsened when Odai shot and 
wounded Barzan al-Tikriti's brother Watban. The Swiss government says 
Barzan al-Tikriti has until the end of the month to leave Geneva under 
Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats to stay on for three months after 
the end of their tenure. Besides her husband, Mrs. al-Tikriti is survived 
by six children, ages 11 to 26.
