 Saddam Hussein has ordered the replacement of 18 Iraqi ambassadors, 
including the country's envoy to the United Nations, government officials 
said Tuesday. Nizar Hamdoon, the ambassador to the United Nations, 
will be replaced by his deputy, Saeed al-Mausawi, the officials said, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. It is not known what 
post Hamdoon will get. Saddam's half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, who 
was Iraq's U.N. representative in Geneva, has already been replaced 
by Mohammed al-Douri, a legal adviser in the foreign ministry, the 
officials said. Iraq signaled it was going to replace its ambassadors 
earlier this year and the new envoys will take office by the end of 
the year, the officials said. The government is said to hope that 
the new envoys will be able to drum up more support for its campaign 
to lift the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 
which led to the Gulf War. The U.N. Security Council has said the 
embargo, which allows only limited sales of oil, will not be lifted 
until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its 
weapons of mass destruction. In two other appointments, Sultan al-Shawi 
will become Iraq's representative at the Arab League in Cairo and 
Naji al-Hadithi, who has long dealt with foreign media in the Culture 
and Information Ministry, will go to Vienna as ambassador to Austria 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA is charged with 
overseeing the scrapping of Iraq's nuclear program.
