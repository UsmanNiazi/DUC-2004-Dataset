U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of them experts on missiles 
_ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the first stage of the U.N. reduction 
of its teams in Iraq. The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said 
it was halting all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which 
oversees the destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons 
as well as long-range missiles. Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM 
here, said the monitors leaving Saturday included six who were ``a 
visiting missile team that just happened to be here when Iraq made 
its announcement.'' ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. 
Cross said. ``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately 
should Iraq have a change of heart.'' She said ``about 15'' staffers 
are expected to fly to Bahrain on a U.N. plane from an air base outside 
Baghdad. The experts are among 26 people that UNSCOM has decided to 
withdraw from its staff of about 120 to 140. The decision announced 
Friday was in response to Iraq's Oct. 31 announcement banning all 
spot inspections and monitoring. It is not known when the other inspectors 
will leave. The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's move 
in a resolution Thursday, but the council remains divided on whether 
to authorize military strikes as favored by the United States and 
Britain. There has so far been no official response by Iraq on the 
resolution. However, Iraq's government newspaper, Al-Jumhouriya, dismissed 
it as a ``conspiracy'' to prolong U.N. sanctions. On Friday, U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a tour of Arab nations 
and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United States would have adequate 
support from Arab allies to carry out military action. But comments 
made by officials in the region indicate that the Arabs may be against 
another war. Iraq's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday 
that any armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences 
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a 
whole.'' Iraq has said it will resume cooperation with UNSCOM only 
if the Security Council gives a timetable for the lifting of the sanctions 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions, however, 
cannot be lifted until UNSCOM says Iraq is free of all weapons of 
mass destruction. Iraq also had a suspected nuclear program, which 
is now believed to be dismantled. The Vienna-headquartered International 
Atomic Energy Agency deals with Iraq's compliance on nuclear issues, 
and its monitors have not been banned by Iraq. Cross, the UNSCOM spokeswoman, 
said a nuclear team went into the field to continue monitoring work 
Saturday. No details were available. Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the 
special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said 
the Security Council has asked Annan to help resolve the standoff. 
Annan signed an agreement with Iraq on Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis 
over inspections of presidential palaces.
