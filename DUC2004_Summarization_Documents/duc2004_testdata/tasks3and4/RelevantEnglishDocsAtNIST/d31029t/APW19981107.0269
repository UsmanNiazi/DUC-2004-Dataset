ed clubs to beat demonstrators and disperse 2,000 marchers 
Saturday who sought to protest last month's presidential elections, 
which they said were undemocratic, according to a news report. Dozens 
of protesters were either beaten, arrested or both by police, who 
never allowed the march to begin in the capital Baku, the Turan news 
agency reported. At least 10 suffered injuries, it said. The rally 
was organized by Etibar Mamedov, leader of the National Independence 
Party, who finished a distant second to the country's authoritarian 
leader Geidar Aliev in presidential elections in October. Aliev won 
another term with 76 percent of the vote last month. Mamedov captured 
only 11 percent, and claimed the poll was rigged. Most opposition 
groups boycotted the election, and international observers said it 
was undemocratic. The marchers initially gathered at a subway station, 
but a large police contingent began beating demonstrators and blocked 
their planned route, the report said. Police also blocked the headquarters 
of the National Independence Party and did not allow Mamedov to take 
part in the march, the report said. The marchers sought to re-form 
the demonstration at Baku State University, but were again beaten 
back by police, the report added. Human rights groups have repeatedly 
criticized Aliev for his crackdowns against opposition groups. Aliev, 
75, led Azerbaijan when it was part of the Soviet Union and reclaimed 
power in a 1993 coup.
