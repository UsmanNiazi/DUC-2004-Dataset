ing opposition groups boycotting the vote, Azerbaijan's authoritarian 
leader looked certain to be re-elected president by voters seeking 
stability and long-elusive prosperity for their oil-rich Caspian Sea 
country. Voters on Sunday chose between President Geidar Aliev, 75, 
and five candidates close to the government, who are widely believed 
to be running only to make the election seem competitive. Opposition 
groups criticized an announcement by the Central Election Commission 
that results would not be known for four days, saying Aliev's government 
was delaying results so it could tamper with the outcome. An unidentified 
spokesman for Aliev's campaign headquarters said that while ballots 
were still being counted ``it's already clear that President Geidar 
Aliev has won,'' the Interfax news agency reported. Turnout was high, 
with 78 percent of eligible voters casting ballots, easily surpassing 
the 25 percent minimum turnout required to validate the election, 
the central election commission reported. Commission member Fuad Agayev 
said there were reports of violations from several regions. In some 
cases, ballots were kept outside polling stations and in Aliev's home 
Nakhichevan region, the turnout was 100 percent _ an almost impossibility, 
Agayev said. Other commission members disagreed with Agayev, who represents 
one of Aliev's rivals, saying there were no serious violations. Voting
