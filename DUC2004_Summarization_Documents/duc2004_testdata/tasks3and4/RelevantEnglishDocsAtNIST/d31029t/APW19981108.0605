econd day in a row, an opposition rally in the Azerbaijani 
capital turned bloody Sunday when several opposition leaders were 
attacked by a mob and beaten. Among the victims was the former president 
of Azerbaijan, Abulfaz Elchibey. The attacks came one day after police 
broke up a rally in Baku with riot sticks, injuring at least 18 people. 
Azerbaijan's political opposition has been demonstrating for months 
against the country's authoritarian president, Geidar Aliev. Aliev 
won re-election last month in a contest that was boycotted by most 
of his leading opponents, and denounced by international observers. 
Demonstrators have been demanding that the results of the balloting 
be struck down. Azerbaijan is a strategically important nation on 
the oil-rich Caspian Sea. It is at the center of an international 
debate that will determine who benefits most from the tapping of the 
Caspian's reserves. About 15,000 people rallied Sunday. Unlike Saturday's 
demonstration, this one had been sanctioned by the local administration, 
and was allowed to take place without apparent incident, despite the 
presence of about 1,000 police. However, immediately after, the gang 
of about 30 unidentified men attacked Elchibey, who is chairman of 
the main opposition group, National Front, and two other leading opposition 
figures. The other two, Democratic Party leader Ilyas Ismailov and 
Liberal Party leader Lalu Shovket Gadzhiev, were especially badly 
beaten. Rally participants managed to detain one of the attackers, 
who was turned over to police. Yashar Aliyev, deputy chief of the 
Baku police, said he was aware of the incident and that it was under 
investigation. Elchibey was Azerbaijan's first president after the 
breakup of the Soviet Union. He was forced from office in June 1993 
by Aliev, who took over after a military mutiny. Aliev had been the 
provincial KGB chief and, later, Communist Party boss, when Azerbaijan 
was a Soviet republic.
