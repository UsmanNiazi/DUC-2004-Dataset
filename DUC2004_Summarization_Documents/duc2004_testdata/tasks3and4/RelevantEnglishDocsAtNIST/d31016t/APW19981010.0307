d Goran Ivanisevic and No. 2 Michael Chang battled past opponents 
Saturday to win their semifinals matches and advance to the finals 
of ATP's Shanghai Open. Ivanisevic from Croatia regained the control 
that eluded him in the first set, the only set he has dropped in four 
rounds of play, to defeat sixth-seeded Ramon Delgado of Paraguay, 
5-7, 6-3, 7-5. American Michael Chang was down 4-5 in the first set 
after a series of errors, but managed to overcome fifth-seeded Paul 
Haarhuis, Netherlands, 7-5, 6-3. Chang said the support of the mostly 
Chinese crowd helped him dig his way out of the first-set hole. ``When 
they started getting behind me it was a great feeling and that's why 
I enjoy playing so much in Asia. And the tide of the match turned 
and it allowed me to go on. It was crucial for me,'' Chang said after 
the match. Ivanisevic and Chang will face off on Sunday.
