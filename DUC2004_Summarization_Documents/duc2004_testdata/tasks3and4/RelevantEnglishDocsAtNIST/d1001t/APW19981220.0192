rime Minister Tony Blair on Sunday outlined a three-pronged 
strategy to keep Saddam Hussein ``in his cage'' following the four-day 
bombing campaign against Iraqi targets. Saddam's military machine 
would ``take years to repair'' and Britain and the United States had 
sent an ``important'' message to the elite Republican Guard, Blair 
told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a television interview in which 
he began to outline the next phase of the U.S.-British plan for Iraq. 
``First of all we need to have a policy of containment, if necessary 
by military means,'' he said. ``Second, tighten the sanctions enforcement 
machine and make sure it's really secure.'' One of the British targets 
of Operation Desert Fox was an oil refinery in the southern Iraq port 
of Basra that the allies said had been used in a sanctions-busting 
plot designed to bring in dollars for Saddam's war machine, he said. 
``Thirdly, we want to see the weapons inspectors go back in there. 
But we need a far better regime where Saddam is going to be cooperating 
properly,'' Blair said. Iraq has already said it will no longer cooperate 
with the U.N. inspectors. The United States and Britain decided to 
attack Iraq after the U.N. Special Commission reported last week that 
Saddam's regime had failed to cooperate fully with its arms inspectors. 
The two nations say that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of mass 
destruction, and has used them against his neighbors. ``We set out 
to diminish and degrade Saddam's military capability, and we have 
done so,'' Blair said Saturday night in announcing the end of the 
attack. ``Substantial damage has been inflicted upon his air defense 
systems, the command and control system for his armed forces, missile 
production capability, and the systems which could be used for chemical 
and biological warfare.'' Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, simultaneously 
announcing a halt to the airstrikes, both said they remain willing 
to strike again if necessary. Blair singled out attacks on the elite 
Republican Guard, which bolsters Saddam's regime, as being of particular 
significance. ``They have been given the message that they are in 
the front line of targets,'' Blair said, adding that the ``poorly 
fed'' conscript army was urged in leaflet drops to stay in barracks 
because it was not the target for British and American pilots. Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook said in a separate television interview on Sunday 
that now the military action was over, the allies needed to build 
``international consensus'' to isolate the Iraqi leader. ``Now it 
is very important that we have come to the end of the military campaign 
that we should launch a diplomatic campaign,'' Cook said. ``We will 
be putting forward a strategy of containment for Saddam.'' But the 
Conservative opposition shadow foreign secretary, Michael Howard, 
said in a television interview that Saddam's removal should be an 
explicit aim of Western policy. ``Now the action is over, we must 
not have a policy vacuum,'' he said.
