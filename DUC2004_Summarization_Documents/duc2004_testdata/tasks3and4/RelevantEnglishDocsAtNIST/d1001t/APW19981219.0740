ce president declared Saturday that the Baghdad regime will 
end all dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees 
weapons inspections, in response to the American and British air strikes. 
Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a half-dozen 
loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the fourth wave of 
punishing missile strikes was under way. Witnesses said that three 
struck near Al-Mustansiriya University in central Baghdad and that 
smoke could be seen rising from the area. It was not immediately clear 
what the missiles hit. Trails of smoke also could be seen rising from 
a building near the city's center. Iraq has been taking a beating 
since overnight Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched 
an air offensive to punish the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons inspectors. In Washington, 
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said about 
90 targets had been struck in Iraq so far and that some were hit more 
than once. ``I am very pleased by the result of our strikes,'' he 
said. Defense Secretary William Cohen, meanwhile, said the missiles 
had inflicted ``significant damage.'' He declined to say when the 
campaign would end, saying: ``It will stop when the president orders 
it to stop.'' Ramadan told a news conference that ``the Special Commission 
is now behind us. Its mission is over.'' He repeated Iraq's allegation 
that UNSCOM was a tool of the Americans, adding: ``Its only mission 
in Iraq now is to find a cover for the genitals of those who want 
to carry out aggression against Iraq.'' The implications of an Iraqi 
decision to shut down U.N. inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged 
with eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as 
long-range missiles. It also is responsible for setting up a long-range 
monitoring program to ensure that Iraq doesn't rebuild its lethal 
arsenal. Destruction of the weapons was mandated by the U.N. Security 
Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. Before the vice 
president began speaking, gun batteries on rooftops sent tracer shells 
streaking across the sky shortly after sundown, as Muslims were breaking 
their fast on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan. Sirens wailed 
a warning for citizens to take cover. The previous attack ended shortly 
before dawn on Saturday and had appeared to be the toughest yet against 
Baghdad. Ramadan declined to give casualty figures, but said that 
the number of civilians killed ``was 10 times more than military men.'' 
He said that 12 students died and many more were wounded Friday night 
when a missile hit a dormitory in the northern province of Tameem. 
The government said earlier that 25 people were killed and 75 injured 
in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi 
News Agency said five more people died and 21 were wounded in a missile 
attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk. 
The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to lessen 
Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten its neighbors 
and attack U.S. interests in the region. But Ramadan repeated Iraq's 
contention that the real goal was to eliminate Saddam. ``I am telling 
those who were promised the elimination of our great leader that the 
symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will remain,'' Ramadan said. 
He added: ``We will fight to the last citizen, and history will glorify 
us.'' Baghdad residents said damage from the missile attacks late 
Friday and early Saturday was heavy and that a number of buildings 
in the center of the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters 
and offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit. The walls of 
the Military Industrialization Corporation, which oversees state-run 
factories, were still standing, but the building appeared to have 
been gutted by missiles. The official Iraqi News Agency said a missile 
had damaged an historic Abbasid palace in Baghdad, parts of which 
date to the year 1180. Ramadan focused on civilian sites that were 
hit, confirming earlier reports that telephone communications with 
southern provinces had been broken. He also charged that the United 
States and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed a factory 
that had been inspected by UNSCOM. In London, British officials showed 
videotapes of bomb hits on Republican Guard facilities in southern 
Iraq, and emphasized that the Guard was a key target of the operation. 
``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office, have 
their own system of repression, and of course have been instrumental 
in putting together the means of concealing the weapons of mass destruction,'' 
Prime Minister Tony Blair said. In a radio address from the White 
House, U.S. President Bill Clinton told listeners ``I believe the 
mission is going well.'' He added: ``Where do we go from here? We 
stand ready to use force again'' should Saddam threaten his neighbors 
or attempt to reconstitute his weaponry. Also Saturday, a second U.S. 
aircraft carrier battle group _ led by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved 
into the Gulf to join the USS Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials 
said. The inspectors, who had been working in Iraq since 1991, withdrew 
on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard Butler told 
the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was not cooperating. That became 
the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks. Until the monitors certify 
that Iraq is free of biological and chemical weapons and long-range 
missiles, the Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed 
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
