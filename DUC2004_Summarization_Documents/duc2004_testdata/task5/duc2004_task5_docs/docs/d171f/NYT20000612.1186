VERMONT CANDIDATE FIRST IN NATION TO QUALIFY FOR FULL PUBLIC
CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ In the old days, Anthony Pollina, a Progressive Party
candidate for governor of Vermont, could have expected to spend his
campaign either holding out his hand for money or relegated to the
fringe.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Wednesday, under the state's new law providing public
financing for statewide campaigns, Pollina announced that he had
just qualified for nearly $300,000 in state money, more than the
incumbent Democratic governor, Howard Dean, will get.
</P>
<P>
   Pollina thus became the first candidate in the country who has
qualified for full public financing to run for a statewide post. He
also became, he said, a fine example of how elections can change
under the ``clean money'' campaign finance overhauls that have
passed in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I've been involved in policy making for 20 years _
grass-roots organizing and coalition building _ I have no desire to
spend huge amounts of time and energy raising huge amounts of
money,'' Pollina said. ``If that's what the campaign was all about,
I would not have had the stomach to do that. Whereas, under the new
rules, I've been able to get out and talk to average Vermonters
about the concerns we have and the vision we share, and then I ask
them for a very small amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new campaign finance law that took effect this
election cycle, Pollina had only to raise contributions of $50 or
less from 1,500 Vermont voters around the state. (Some donations
were as small as 50 cents, he said.) The contributions had to
amount to at least $35,000, and to be gathered in the five-month
period from February to July. The state will now give him enough
public money to reach a $300,000 total campaign budget, which he
said he would spend largely on canvassing and door-to-door work, as
well as on staff and paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who signed the campaign finance overhaul into law after
the Legislature passed it in 1997, is also gathering the small
contributions needed to qualify for public financing. But the law,
aiming to offset the advantages of incumbency, allows him a budget
of only $255,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two other contenders, both Republicans, are running for
governor. One, Ruth Dwyer, a farmer and former Republican nominee
for governor, has said she will not use the public financing
option, but will raise her campaign money herself. The other, Bill
Meub, a lawyer, former dairy farmer and former bacteriologist for
the New York City Health Department, is trying to gather the public
financing contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The course of the campaign could suddenly change, however.
Several aspects of the Vermont law are being challenged in court,
including its overall spending cap of $300,000 for gubernatorial
candidates and its limits on out-of-state contributions. It could
be overturned in the coming weeks, in time to affect the current
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the law, who have been arguing for campaign
finance reform in court in recent appearances that effectively
amounted to putting the country's campaign finance system on trial,
say they would probably appeal if the law was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone like Anthony Pollina and others who have not in the
past had access to large sums of money are able to enter into this
process because of this law, and it only bodes well for Vermont's
democracy,'' said John Bonifaz, executive director of the National
Voting Rights Institute, a national nonprofit group specializing in
campaign finance litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the law means for Vermont's democracy, it means a
tougher-than-usual race for Dean, though a recent state poll showed
him comfortably in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, a physician, said Wednesday that he believed in the law
but was finding himself squeezed from the left by Pollina on the
liberal side and from the right by Dwyer, who, if the law is
overturned, may suddenly be able to spend as much money as she can
raise.
</P>
<P>
   (An early poll showed Pollina with only about 5 percent of the
public supporting him, but he pointed out that it was taken before
he began campaigning.)
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mix the criticism of Dean from some quarters for
signing a bill allowing marriagelike ``civil unions'' for gay
couples, and it is clear why he is sounding unusually nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is pretty tough,'' Dean, who has held his post
since 1991, said of running under the clean money strictures, ``but
it's the right thing to do.''
