   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Lorraine Lacaillade, a 75-year-old widow in
Bolton, about 25 miles southeast of here, lives on about $12,000 a
year, most of it from Social Security. She takes prescription drugs
for arthritis and other conditions that would cost more than $1,000
a year if she had to pay for them herself.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Vermont, a state in the vanguard of offering health
benefits to its residents. Under the Vermont Health Access Plan, a
program for people who are earning just enough to make ends meet,
Lacaillade only pays $3 a month for her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine is awfully expensive today,'' she said. ``The old
people need some help.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the prevailing philosophy here, embraced by the
Democratic governor, state legislators from both parties, doctors
and, clearly, the public.
</P>
<P>
   The array of health benefits that Vermont provides its residents
_ not just the elderly but also children and low-income adults _ is
unmatched by any other state.
</P>
<P>
   And while many of Vermont's programs would not work in larger
and more urban states, other aspects could serve as models. Today,
93.5 percent of all Vermont residents have health insurance,
including essentially all children. By contrast, only 63 percent of
low-income children in Texas and 60 percent in Arizona are insured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view that health insurance ought to be universal, the
right of every citizen in Vermont,'' Gov. Howard Dean said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program called Dr. Dynasaur (some marketing wizard
thought up the odd spelling), the state has guaranteed free medical
and dental care to every resident age 18 and younger from a family
with income below about $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Adults with income below 150 percent of the federal poverty line
are entitled to medical coverage for a nominal fee. The poverty
line, for instance, is $8,350 this year for a single person and
$17,050 for a family of four. That means a single adult with less
than $12,500 is eligible, as is a family of four with less than
$25,500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, health insurance companies are required to sell
policies to residents who request one, and must provide them at the
same cost to all customers, regardless of their age or medical
history.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what this can mean for a family: Gary and Sheila Clayton
live in Burlington, barely making ends meet. He is a glazier for a
company that does commercial and residential glass work. She works
part time as a clerk in a doctor's office. They have three
children, 12, 10 and 5. If they took family health insurance
through Clayton's employer, it would cost $89 a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clayton children are covered by the Dr. Dynasaur
program. And under the Vermont program for families with incomes
only slightly above the poverty line, the couple pay only $40 every
six months for their own coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley, the 5-year-old, was born, he spent a week in the
hospital in the neonatal care unit. The hospital bill was almost
$10,000; Dr. Dynasaur paid all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Dean, a Democrat, and his wife, Judy Steinberg, are
physicians, and the generous health benefits are largely his doing.
</P>
<P>
   He took office in 1991 determined to pass legislation that in
one fell swoop would provide health coverage to everyone in
Vermont. His bill was similar to the one offered by the Clinton
administration in 1993, and it was defeated in the state
Legislature in 1994, just months before the Clinton plan died in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So Dean began implementing the plan gradually _ extending
coverage to low-income adults in one year, providing drug coverage
to the elderly in another, expanding coverage for children in yet
another. This year, 28,600 elderly and disabled Vermont residents,
about one-third of those on Medicare, receive drug coverage under
the state program. The Dr. Dynasaur program covers 55,000 of the
state's 145,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now realize that the only way you can do this is
incrementally,'' Dean said. ``You do it piece by piece and bit by
bit because you can't take on every special interest all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the cost of the expanded benefits is picked up by
Washington under the Medicaid program. But the state's share is
considerable, which is why other states have not adopted similar
measures.
</P>
<P>
   With advances in health benefits paralyzed in Washington because
of partisan warfare, Dean has accomplished his goals with little
Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is not a partisan issue in Vermont,'' said John
Bloomer Jr., a Republican leader in the state Senate. ``Generally
speaking, it's a bipartisan goal to expand health care access and
affordability.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is hardly typical. It is a rural state with a population
of about 591,000, less than Milwaukee's. Ninety-eight percent of
the residents are white, and few people move into the state. The
poverty rate is somewhat below the national average, but so are
wages and per capita income.
</P>
<P>
   Dean conceded that if Vermont were less remote, his program of
requiring insurance companies to offer health insurance at the same
rates to everyone would not work. People with serious, chronic
illnesses would move in just for the insurance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But larger states could learn from parts of the Vermont
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, for instance, Vermont had a serious problem
with teen-age pregnancy. Now, it has the lowest rate of adolescent
pregnancy in the nation. The governor credits the Dr. Dynasaur
program for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph F. Hagan Jr., a pediatrician in Burlington, was not
willing to give all the credit to the program, but he said it
certainly made a difference. For one thing, Hagan said, teen-age
girls go to the doctor more often now than they did when they had
to pay for it, and they get counseling and sex education. For
another, the program pays for birth-control pills and other
contraceptives. Girls can get them without their parents having to
pay the bill _ in fact, without their parents even knowing.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with the elderly said they could also see the
difference since the state's health programs became more extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't have the insurance, they wouldn't take their
medicine,'' said John Barbour, executive director of the Champlain
Valley Agency on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not without drawbacks. Take the case of the
Cookson family in Huntington, a small community east of here. Owen
Cookson is a construction foreman who made good money with overtime
in the summer and little in the winter. Marie Cookson works out of
their small A-frame house preparing income tax returns. They have
three children. Cookson has $50 a week withheld from his paycheck
for employer-provided health insurance that starts after a $4,000
annual family deductible has been met.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Nathan, 12, had to go to the emergency room recently
with an inflammation. That bill was $400, and the family faces
hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in bills for additional
tests.
</P>
<P>
   If this had happened in the winter, the bills would have been
paid by Dr. Dynasaur, which covers deductibles and copayments for
families with private insurance. But eligibility is calculated
monthly, and Cookson earned enough in May, one of the months when
construction work is plentiful, to push the family's monthly income
beyond qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a lot of money we're paying out,'' Mrs.
Cookson said. ``And we can hardly afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are also concerned. Dr. Thomas A.E. Moseley, a
pediatrician at a rural health clinic in Newport near the Canadian
border, said he had seen a huge difference because of Dr. Dynasaur
in the number of children receiving preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Holy Grail of pediatrics,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   But 75 percent of his practice involves Dr. Dynasaur patients.
He is paid at the Medicaid rate, which is often not enough to cover
his costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed blessing,'' Moseley said. ``The problem is far
from being solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean is also worried. The costs of the health benefits are
rising. Drug costs alone are rising at a rate of 18 percent a year.
The state has a budget surplus now. But if the economy turns sour,
the governor says, he may have to ask the more affluent families on
the Dr. Dynasaur program to make copayments.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he said, he hoped to install a program that would
allow everyone in the state with income below 300 percent of the
poverty level to get prescription drugs at the same lower rate paid
by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it another incremental step.
