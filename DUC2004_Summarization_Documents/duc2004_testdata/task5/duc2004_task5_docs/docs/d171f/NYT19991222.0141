MARRIAGE LITE JUST WON'T CUT IT

<P>
   The Emancipation Proclamation made people uncomfortable. So did
women's suffrage. To say nothing of the social unease prompted by
interfaith marriages and school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the governor of Vermont would deny same-sex couples the
right to marry for no more substantive reason than because he says
it ``makes me uncomfortable, the same as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for a moment, that ``anybody else'' is not everybody
else. When did we begin apportioning civil rights in this country
on the basis of the citizenry's comfort level?
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court dropped the prospect of gay marriages
into the laps of the governor and state lawmakers this week with
its decision that homosexual couples are entitled to the same
benefits and protections as married couples. The high court left it
to legislators to design the remedy to current discriminatory
practices in such commonplace matters as insurance, medical
decisions, hospital visitation, and property division in the event
of separation.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Howard Dean says gay marriage is out of the question
but a parallel ``domestic partnership'' law might work. Sort of
marriage lite, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am missing something, but isn't ``domestic partnership''
the definition of marriage? Why would lawmakers waste energy
creating a new civil institution when an existing one would fit the
bill nicely?
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled that the denial of equal protection to
homosexual couples violated the Common Benefits Clause of the
Vermont Constitution, a provision beautiful in its simplicity and
clarity: ``That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the
common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or
community, and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any
single person, family or set of persons, who are a part only of
that community.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the issue of same-sex marriage ``arouses
deeply felt religious, moral and political beliefs,'' the justices
were mum on every aspect but the legal one.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders should do likewise and
leave the moral wrestling to the clerics and to the conscience of
their constituents. Governor Dean and Vermont lawmakers are not
being asked to make a moral judgment about same-sex couplings, only
to remedy the discrimination to which homosexual couples are now
subjected.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution is to extend the right to marry to gay and
lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic partnership proposals are no more than a political
dodge, an unconscionable sop to bigots who will tolerate
homosexuality only if it can be segregated in some parallel
universe. But gay and lesbian people do not live in a parallel
universe. They live in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Why should our brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, sons, and
daughters be relegated to faux marriages simply to appease those
who can live more easily with discrimination than they can with
discomfort?
</P>
<P>
   Why should gays and lesbians accept the second-class status
implicit in a ``separate but equal'' domestic partnership statute?
</P>
<P>
   The debate Vermont lawmakers promise to begin after the first of
the year should focus not on what religious leaders claim the Bible
commands, but on what the state's Supreme Court justices insist
that the Constitution mandates.
</P>
<P>
   No significant social change in this nation's history has been
accomplished without disrupting some deeply held beliefs. Blacks
were slaves because whites were superior. Wives were chattel
because women were weak-minded. Amending our laws in a continuing
effort to equalize the status of all Americans has not diminished
the nation; it has enhanced it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have learned, with varying degrees of comfort, to live
with blacks and women who vote, with couples who celebrate
Christmas and Hanukkah, with schools that teach students of
different shades side by side.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision this week, the Vermont Supreme Court justices
noted they were duty-bound to consider the legal questions raised
by the two lesbian couples and two gay men who were the plaintiffs
in this case, without regard to their personal comfort. ``Our
constitutional responsibility to consider the legal merits of
issues properly before us provides no exception for the
controversial case,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court unlocked the door to equality for gay
and lesbian couples. Now, it is up to the governor and state
lawmakers to push it open wide.
