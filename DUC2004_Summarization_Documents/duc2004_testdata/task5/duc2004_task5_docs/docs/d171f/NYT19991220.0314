COURT SAYS SAME-SEX COUPLES DESERVE LEGAL PROTECTION

<P>
   In a groundbreaking ruling that could have national
implications, the Vermont Supreme Court Monday said gay and lesbian
couples are entitled to the same marriage benefits and protections
as heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   But the court stopped short of ruling that gay and lesbian
couples must be recognized under Vermont's existing marriage laws.
Instead, it ordered the state Legislature to decide whether it will
apply those laws to same-sex couples or create a new system of
``domestic partnerships'' providing gays and lesbians with an
equivalent legal status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever system is chosen must conform with the constitutional
imperative to provide all Vermonters with the common benefit,
protection, and security of the law,'' wrote Chief Justice Jeffrey
L. Amestoy.
</P>
<P>
   Amestoy also wrote that providing same-sex couples with ``legal
protection and security for their avowed commitment to an intimate
and lasting human relationship is simply, when all is said and
done, a recognition of our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Governor Howard Dean and leaders of the Legislature
indicated Monday they would favor a parallel system of domestic
partnership instead of gay marriage. But the plaintiff's lawyers
said they would seek full marital status from the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not over,'' said Beth Robinson, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs. ``It's over when people finally start marrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, gay and lesbian activists were thrilled by Monday's
ruling, calling it a landmark civil-rights victory and a legal
precedent that could eventually ripple throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed with the argument of the plaintiffs, two gay
male couples and one lesbian couple, that the state's refusal to
allow them to marry amounted to discrimination under Vermont's
constitution. Marriage provides more than 1,300 state and federal
benefits, they said, affecting taxes, inheritance _ even the right
to visit a dying partner in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have confronted the politically sensitive issue of
gay marriage, notably Hawaii, where the state's high court ruled
that banning gay marriage amounted to sex discrimination. However,
voters passed a constitutional amendment which rendered the
Hawaiian court's decision moot.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, no state recognizes same-sex marriage or other legal
unions with equivalent benefits and protections. The US Congress
and 30 states have passed so-called ``defense of marriage'' laws
explicitly preventing recognition of gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the decision of this court,'' said
Jennifer Levi, an attorney with Gay &AMP; Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders
in Boston, which acted as co-counsel in the case. ``This really is
the first court to recognize the importance of extending the full
range of protections and benefits of marriage to same sex
couples.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision will have no direct effect outside Vermont, but
some legal scholars predicted that other state courts could follow
Vermont's logic.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont court's opinion will serve as a ``powerful and
persuasive precedent throughout the country,'' Harvard Law School
professor Laurence Tribe said Monday, and is ``likely to carry a
great deal of weight in other states,'' where similar court
challenges may soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservatives, while relieved the ruling does not
require legalized same-sex marriage, expressed serious reservations
about domestic partnerships as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, director of the American Center for Law and
Justice, a legal group that has challenged same-sex marriage
nationally, said he feared the ruling would lead to ``a fundamental
redefinition of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ACLJ spokesman Gene Kapp added the group did not consider
domestic partnership benefits an acceptable compromise. ``The
unmarried couple should not receive the same benefits as a married
couple,'' Kapp said.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Dean, citing ``a clear discomfort in Vermont and
elsewhere around the country over gay marrage,'' said the state's
political leadership almost certainly would opt for domestic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the legislature will probably pass a domestic
partnership act guaranteeing equal rights,'' the governor said,
adding: ``There is no possibility a gay marriage act is going to
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   State House Speaker Michael Obuchowski was less certain, but
said that ``domestic partnership is probably more attainable than
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling only asks that the legislature act within a
``reasonable period of time.'' But Obuchowski said he expects
hearings to begin on the issue early next month, and is hopeful the
issue can be resolved before the legislature's scheduled
adjournment date of April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has no immediate impact on Massachusetts, but some
gay marriage advocates expressed optimism that couples eventually
could drive to Vermont, get married, and return home seeking
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter it means nobody should rush to Vermont
over the holiday vacation to get married, because you can't _ and
you can't even get the same legal rights and protections today,''
said Peter Teachout, a constitutional scholar at Vermont Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians, activists and scholars agreed that the only way
other states would be obliged to honor gay unions in Vermont is if
the state legislature approves marriage rather than domestic
partnership. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, for instance,
once argued that the US Constitution's ``Full Faith and Credit''
clause would require the state to recognize a same-sex marriage
legally performed in another state. Governor Paul Cellucci, an
opponent of gay marriage, does not share that view.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci said Monday he does not believe the Vermont ruling
will set a precedent for other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much that that would be what the Supreme Court of
the United States would say about the US Constitution, and I doubt
that's what the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts would say
abt the Massachusetts Constitution,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's view differed from that of Harvard's Tribe,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the right ruling under the constitutional law of
many states'' which, like Vermont, have expansive equal-protection
clauses, Tribe said. ``It would be very hard for a Massachusetts
court not to find this a fairly powerful line of analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   But US Representative Barney Frank said gay-rights advocates
should let the nation watch the effects of Vermont's new law before
pushing for change around the country faster than the public is
ready to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to give us a chance to show the fallacy of the
argument that allowing the same-sex couple to be legally as well as
emotionally committed to each other somhow jeopardizes heterosexual
marriage,'' Frank said. ``Let's let Vermont work this out and let
the rest of the country benefit from the experience we see in
Vermont.''
