<P>
   A voter backlash against civil unions for same-sex couples
claimed the careers of several veteran Republican lawmakers in
Vermont, Tuesday, but the state's Democratic auditor running for
the US Senate was not one of the victims. In fact, Edward Flanagan
now appears to be the nation's first openly gay US Senate nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, who is Vermont's only openly gay statewide
office-holder, won the Democratic nomination by 1,000 votes out of
34,000 cast over challenger Jan Backus and will now face incumbent
US Senator Jim Jeffords, who won 79 percent of the vote in the
Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   But Vermont, which has been riven by the new law allowing gay
couples most of the rights of married couples, bounced six
lawmakers who had supported the measure. Five of the state
legislators who were ousted were Republicans and one was a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who supported civil unions and were swept
out of office was Marion Milne of Williamstown. She said that
during the campaign, her 13-year-old grandson became the target of
an ugly anti-gay epithet when he was collecting signatures for her.
</P>
<P>
   Also defeated was John Edwards of Swanton, which is near the
Canadian border. A three-term Republican incumbent, he serves on
the House Judiciary Committee and was also targeted by the
opponents of civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote was the first opportunity for Vermonters to cast
a ballot since the civil unions law was approved in April and took
effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably something that's going to take a generation
to resolve,'' said Thomas Little, the Republican chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee. Although Little was one of the sponsors
of the legislation, he beat back his challenger, Rod Fisher, by a
vote of 617-428.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund of Washington, D.C., a national
advocacy group that works to elect gay and lesbian candidates to
public office, hailed Flanagan's primary victory. It said that,
based on its research, he was the first open gay or lesbian
candidate to be the nominee of either major party for a seat in the
US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently three members of the US House who are openly
gay or lesbian, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartening that despite the gay baiting and backlash
against civil unions, a great candidate was able to prevail on his
merits as a candidatate,'' said a spokesman for the group, Sloan
Wiesen.
</P>
<P>
   But Flanagan, the auditor whose campaign mascot was a bulldog,
said that the upheaval over civil unions was less of an issue in
his race and noted that he drew support in some of communities that
turned against the lawmakers who voted for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a minor factor,'' Flanagan said of the
first-in-the-nation law. ``Yes, there is a roiling debate in
Vermont over civil unions. But Jim Jeffords and I have precisely
the same stand on the issue. We won because we spoke to the issues
of concern to voters, such as the need for health-care reform,
funding for special education and campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much of an issue civil unions would be in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of it will be familiar: Governor Howard Dean, a
Democrat, who was renominated Tuesday with almost 90 percent of the
vote, will face Republican Ruth Dwyer, an outspoken opponent of the
civil unions law who took 58 percent of the vote in her party's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the race will be a rematch of the 1998 face-off
when Dean won his fourth full term by a 56-41 margin over Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief features of the primary campaign was the
surprising strength of the opponents of civil unions, who succeeded
in plastering their adopted slogan, ``Take Back Vermont,'' all over
the landscape. Signs proclaiming that message _ which was used
previously in the fight against the controversial Act 60 property
tax _ were tacked to utilitly poles, hung from front porches,
nailed to the sides of barns posted in yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer did not specifically mention that civil unions law in her
acceptance speech late Tuesday night, but she did signal the main
message of the ``Take Back Vermont'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue is listening to Vermonters,'' she told
supporters in Montpelier. The people control their own state. We
want to give it back to them.''
