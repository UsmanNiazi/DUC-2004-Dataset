<HEADLINE> Governor Abandons Public Funding  </HEADLINE>

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Gov. Howard Dean on Friday abandoned
public funding for his re-election campaign, saying he couldn't
take the chance he would be outspent 4-1 by his Republican
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly financed campaigns were part of strict campaign finance
reform legislation championed by Dean, who signed it into law in
1997. Much of the law was overturned last week by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, a Democrat, said he would spend as much money as it takes
to counter what he called the ''fear-mongering'' campaign of likely
opponent Ruth Dwyer. ''I am not going to fight this campaign with
one hand tied behind my back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said that if re-elected he would work with the Legislature
to correct flaws in the law. ''I regret this,'' said Dean. ''I
believe in public funding of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized as ''hateful'' comments Dwyer made Thursday on a
radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed the National Education Association -- the
union that represents most Vermont teachers -- was promoting the
''homosexual agenda.'' Dwyer also said she didn't think Vermont
needed a hate crimes law because such crimes could be prosecuted
under other statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of subtexts in this campaign and I don't like
them,'' Dean said. ''It's about fear mongering and picking on
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer was in Maine for a political fund-raiser and not available
for comment. Her campaign manager, Kathleen Summers, said Dean's
comments showed he was running scared.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like somebody who has some competition and doesn't
know how to handle it,'' Summers said. ''This is a governor who has
abandoned what has supposedly been a staple of his policy, which is
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The law limited campaign contributions and spending and offered
public financing to candidates for governor and lieutenant
governor. It also targets so-called soft money by limiting indirect
contributions and out-of-state contributions to 25 percent of a
candidate's total campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive Party gubernatorial candidate Anthony Pollina, the
only candidate now using public funding, criticized Dean's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not surprised. In some way it shows his true colors,''
Pollina said. ''Ultimately, it's a victory for big money and bad
for average citizens.''
