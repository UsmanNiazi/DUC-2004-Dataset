   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Howard Dean, the governor of Vermont, is
expected to endorse Vice President Al Gore for president Wednesday
in Lebanon, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is to take place during a tour of a children's
center there. Dean, who was not available for comment Tuesday, is a
former chairman of the national governors' association and of the
Democratic governors' association.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a physician who made health care the centerpiece of
his early tenure as governor of Vermont. In 1992, Dean signed a
bill to negotatiate with insurance companies for universal
coverage. That bill was later rejected by the Vermont legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Dean also promoted early childhood development with a Success by
Six prevention program that offered home visits to babies. And he
has worked to subsidize health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing Gore, Dean is expected to say that he favors Gore's
health care plan over the proposal offered by Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator. Gore's plan would attempt to cover all
children and their families by the end of the next president's
administration.
