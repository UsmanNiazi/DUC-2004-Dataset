<HEADLINE> Vermont Gov. Signs Gay Union Bill  </HEADLINE>

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Gov. Howard Dean signed a
first-in-the-nation law Wednesday granting gay couples nearly all
of the benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a courageous and powerful statement about who we
are in the state of Vermont,'' the Democrat said. ''I also believe
that this legislation speaks to the heart of this state, and
certainly to my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation creating marriage-like ''civil unions'' reached
the governor's desk shortly before lunch time, just a day after the
House gave its final approval. And by the time of a 2 p.m. news
conference, he had already signed it out of view of TV cameras,
photographers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said he signed the bill privately because he did not want
the ceremony to be a triumphal party by supporters of the law.
Instead, he said, it was time for the state to begin healing.
</P>
<P>
   ''In politics, bill-signings are triumphal,'' he said. ''They
represent overcoming of one side over another. These celebrations,
as the subject of the matter of the bill, will be private.''
</P>
<P>
   The law will allow gay couples to form civil unions beginning
July 1. That will entitle them to all of the 300 or so rights and
responsibilities available to married couples under Vermont law in
such areas as taxes, inheritance and medical decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Other states will probably not recognize Vermont civil unions,
and such status will not entitle gay couples to any the benefits
available to married couples under federal law in areas such as
taxes and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, no state has gone further than Vermont is giving
gay couples something approximating marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill came about after the Vermont Supreme Court unanimously
ruled in December that gay couples were being unconstitutionally
denied the benefits of marriage. The court left it up to the
Legislature time to decide whether to let gays marry or to create
some kind of domestic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed after strong debate in which opponents
argued that homosexuality is ''against natural law.'' Opponents
have warned that they will make their anger known at the polls in
November when members of the Legislature are up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, gay couples will be able to go to their town
clerks for licenses and have their unions certified by a judge or
member of the clergy. Breakups will be handled in Family Court,
just as divorces are, although they will be called dissolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers deeply involved in the issue said they were
disappointed there was no bill-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the story needs to be that gay and lesbian couples in
Vermont had a historical day,'' said Democratic Rep. William
Lippert, the Legislature's only openly gay member.
