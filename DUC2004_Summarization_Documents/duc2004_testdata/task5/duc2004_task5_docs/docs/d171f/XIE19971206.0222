<HEADLINE> Democratic Governor Indicates Intention to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore,
already facing the prospect of competition for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000, will have another potential
Democrat rival -- Vermont Governor Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
Howard Dean, the head of the Democratic Governor's Association,
told Gore Wednesday that he was running for president, said
several Democratic sources in Washington and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
Senator Bob Kerry of Nebraska, head of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, and House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, are also making early plans to challenge Gore. President
Bill Clinton has said he wants Gore to succeed him in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Dean's press secretary, Stephanie Carter, confirmed that the
governor met with the vice president, but would not say what the
two men discussed, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Aides said Gore was not surprised by Dean's revelation. The
Vermont governor said last month he was thinking about running for
president, but would put off a decision until next year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, though, he met with Gore at the vice president's
West Wing office and said his presidential bid is serious,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Dean, as chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, has
been traveling heavily this year seeking to recruit Democratic
gubernatorial candidates for next year.
