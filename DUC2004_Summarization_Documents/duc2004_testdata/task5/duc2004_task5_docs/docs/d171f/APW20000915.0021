<HEADLINE> Vt. Gov. Deals With Civil Unions  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD

   EAST FAIRFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- A small, hand-lettered sign hangs
from a utility pole on Vermont's Route 36 with the message ''Dump
Dean.'' Farther east, the words ''Gone Homo'' are scrawled on duct
tape beneath the governor's name on a campaign sign.
</P>
<P>
   These are difficult days for Howard Dean, Vermont's once popular
governor here in farm country, which in most years forms the
foundation of a Democratic candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Civil unions, providing marriage benefits for same-sex couples,
changed all that. Democrats whose support could always be taken for
granted have abandoned the governor, and many are taking a look at
Republican nominee Ruth Dwyer. State polls show Dean's favorability
rating has slipped from 63 percent in February to 41 percent, a
tumble that followed passage of the civil unions law.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he showed up at a dairy farm Thursday just after
sunrise to begin his fall campaign for re-election. He's not taking
Franklin County, a Democratic stronghold between Burlington and the
Canadian border, for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be very clear that I'm not giving up Franklin County
for anything,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's kickoff came two days after a record number of
Vermonters voted in state primary elections and ousted Republican
legislators who supported the homosexual rights law.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen people showed up outside Tom and Sue Howrigan's
new cow barn Thursday to greet the governor and listen to his
message about agriculture, education, health care, prescription
drug prices and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the folks had reservations about civil unions. But
there was still support for Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's ''the better of all the evils,'' Tom Howrigan said.
''There's a lot of issues I don't really agree on, but I think for
the overall picture for agriculture, he's the better candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Farming still dominates Franklin County, where a few families
form the backbone of civic life. The Howrigans are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Phil Hoff, a Democrat, said Dean needed to work hard
not only because of civil unions but also because after more than
nine years in office, some voters are beginning to tire of him.
Dean, 51, is running for his fifth two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hoff said he thought it was unlikely Vermont would choose
someone as conservative as Dwyer, who wants to repeal the civil
unions law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not terribly concerned,'' Hoff said, but warned: ''I don't
think it's going to be an easy ride or that he can take it for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dean is working to strengthen his base, drawing people like
the Howrigan family back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've developed over the summer support among the leadership of
Franklin County that I didn't have for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than civil unions, agriculture is what concerns the
great majority of people in this region. And, because it's what
they talk about, it's what the politicians are emphasizing.
</P>
<P>
   That's reminded some people who have been disappointed with
Dean's support for civil unions that they have much more in common
with the Democrats than that high-profile issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when the dust settles, he'll do very well,'' said
Harold Howrigan. ''He's a good, strong businessperson, agriculture
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Howrigan has been talking to friends and neighbors about
what he believes are the good things that Dean has achieved,
including the governor's support for the Northeast Interstate Dairy
Compact, which pays New England farmers a premium for their milk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the losses if Dean were to be voted out of office would be
state Agriculture Commissioner Leon Graves, whom Howrigan described
as ''extremely knowledgeable with endless energy.''
</P>
<P>
   That message is being carried farm by farm across rural Franklin
County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to stay away from politics,'' Sue Howrigan said after
bending the governor's ear about higher education. ''But I think as
it gets close to the election, they're going to realize the good
that he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean hopes so. But he sees signs like those along Route 36 and
knows he can't glide to re-election this time. So he spent Thursday
crisscrossing the state to continue the conversations he says he
wants to have with Vermont's voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fighting in every county in the state,'' Dean said.
