<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday he is to award outgoing German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
a Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fitting tribute to the extraordinary accomplishments
of Chancellor Kohl," Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
He said Kohl will "rank among those who changed the course of
history" for his leadership in reunifying Germany after the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In Germany's September elections, Kohl's Christian Democrats
posted their worst showing in 50 years, and the Social Democrats'
leader Gerhard Schroeder won the chancellorship and is to assume
the office at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"Helmut Kohl has been a lifelong friend of the United States
and has personally committed himself to the enduring partnership
of our two countries," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of all Americans, it is my profound pleasure to
honor him with this symbol of our nation's high esteem and deep
appreciation," he said.
