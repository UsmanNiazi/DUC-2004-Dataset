<HEADLINE> Kissinger meets with Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The former American Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger met with the former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl Thursday in Berlin. Kissinger's meeting with Kohl was under
heavy pressure because of the finance scandal of the German
opposition party Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since last
November.
</P>
<P>
Two famous leaders met with each other in Berlin's Adlon Hotel
and showed their intimate friendship to the public, but the topics
of their talks were not clear.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger will also meet with German president Johannes Rau,
but the meeting had been canceled because Rau was light injured by
an accident in his house.
</P>
<P>
Next Monday will be the 70th birthday of Helmut Kohl.
Originally the CDU will hold a celebration for him, but because of
the finance scandal of the party nobody will still arrange an
official celebration for Kohl's 70th birthday except Berlin's CDU
under the leadership of mayor Eberhard Diepgen.
