<HEADLINE> Kohl Rejects Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
flatly rejected repeated calls for a cabinet reshuffle by Finance
Minister Theo Waigel on his first day back to work from a
four-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
"I do not plan to reshuffle the cabinet. There is absolutely no
reason to do so," Kohl told the mass circulation newspaper Bild in
an interview to be published on Tuesday, copies of which were made
available in advance to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he was "very angry" over Waigel's public request for
cabinet changes, adding that under the German constitution a
decision to reshuffle the cabinet was the responsibility of the
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he praised Waigel for doing "a first class
job."
</P>
<P>
Waigel has been Kohl's finance minister for nine years. He has
bore the brunt of voter complaints over Bonn's budget austerity,
entitlement cuts and post-unification tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, he called for a new team in Kohl's center-right
coalition and said he would not continue his current job after
next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has been denying any reshuffle plan over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Kohl's party and many press reports believe
that a cabinet reshuffle could help the ruling coalition by
offering new faces in the September 21 regional election in
Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that the main opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) were widening their lead over the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine spoke on the
coalition turmoil at a news conference: "This is about Helmut Kohl
and his policies. It is an admission of failed economic and
finance policy when the finance minister wants to quit his post 13
months before (general) elections."
</P>
<P>
"I have the feeling that (Kohl) has lost control," he said.
