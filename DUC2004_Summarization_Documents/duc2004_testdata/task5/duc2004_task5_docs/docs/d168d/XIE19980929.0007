<HEADLINE> Former UK PM Major Pays Tribute to Outgoing German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister
John Major Monday paid tribute to outgoing German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who was defeated in Sunday's German general election.
</P>
<P>
Major, whose Conservative Party was defeated in British general
election last May, told BBC Radio: "I'm very fond of Helmut Kohl.
His image sometimes over here has not been good because it has
been portrayed in a very downbeat way."
</P>
<P>
"But the truth is that he was and is a very remarkable man.
Insofar as his policies could accommodate it he was very
pro-British and was often extremely helpful. He rarely got credit
for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major, who described German reunification as a "very remarkable
event", also paid tribute to Kohl's role as a "strong NATO ally"
and to his "enormous contribution" to the European Union.
