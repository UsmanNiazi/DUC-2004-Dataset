	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's wife says her
husband has the support of world leaders who want to see him
re-elected _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``They all say, `Helmut, we've got our fingers crossed. You do
it,'' Hannelore Kohl was quoted as saying in the weekly Munich
gossip magazine Bunte. The rare interview _ Mrs. Kohl usually does
not speak to the press _ was published Tuesday.
	   Kohl, the West's longest serving leader, is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term in elections Sunday. His campaign against
rival Gerhard Schroeder has emphasized Kohl's experience with
international diplomacy and clout with world politicians.
	   Mrs. Kohl also put a positive spin on derisive campaign comments
that her portly, 68-year-old husband resembles an elephant. The
elephant is ``an animal of special strength and sensitivity,'' she
said, adding ``A thick skin isn't so bad.''
	   The chancellor can be clever, too, she was quoted as saying. As
evidence, Mrs. Kohl told a story about a trip her husband took as a
young man to France. Spotting a young woman in a cafe, he bet his
friends he could meet her within 20 minutes.
	   ``I was the French girl, naturally,'' Mrs. Kohl told Bunte,
explaining that the two had met before at dance classes back in
Germany. His friends did not know that. And Kohl won the bet.
