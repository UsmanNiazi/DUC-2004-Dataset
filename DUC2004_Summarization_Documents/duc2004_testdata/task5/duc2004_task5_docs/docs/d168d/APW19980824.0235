	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl voiced trust in
Russia's new premier Monday and urged him to press ahead with
economic reforms to stem the nation's financial crisis.
	   Kohl ``has faith that Viktor Chernomyrdin can push through the
necessary decisions in view of the dramatic and serious situation
in Russia,'' his spokesman Otto Hauser said in a statement.
	   He said Kohl has confidence in Chernomyrdin after ``years of
good cooperation'' in the past.
	   Separately, a leading International Monetary Fund official was
quoted as blaming the Russian crisis on Kohl's refusal to seek an
international bailout.
	   The situation in Russia became ``untenable'' after leading
industrial nations refused to rush to its aid, IMF deputy director
Stanley Fischer told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
	   ``Without the Germans, of course no other European country was
prepared to support Russia financially,'' he said.
	   ``I'm not sure whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl wouldn't have
acted differently if elections were two years away and not six
weeks,'' he said.
	   Kohl is trailing his Social Democratic Part challenger, Gerhard
Schroeder, in opinion polls ahead of federal elections on Sept. 27.
Germany has enormous exposure in Russia, largely in the form of
direct credit and credit guarantees.
