<HEADLINE> Round-up: Yeltsin Gets Cautious Backing from Kohl  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin gained
cautious support from his "dear friend," visiting German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for his bid to win a second term in the
June election.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 65, the first Western leader received by Yeltsin after he
declared his presidential candidacy in his home town,
Yekaterinburg last Thursday, made it quite clear after his
150-minute talks with Yeltsin here Monday that he favored success
for the Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
"It is not my business to interfere in the presidential
election campaign in Russia," he said. "But as chancellor of
Germany, I want to welcome once again the link between Yeltsin's
determination to be re-elected and his willingness to continue
economic reforms."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived here Sunday night, also visited
St. Petersburg, the second largest city in Russia, before
returning to Bonn on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his busy Moscow trip, he also met with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and speakers of both the lower and upper houses of the Russian
parliament, Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although no major agreements were signed during his three-day
official visit, the trip itself demonstrated support from the West
for Yeltsin, who is facing a strong challenge from the Communists
in running for the presidency in the June 16 polls.
</P>
<P>
In last December's parliamentary elections, the Communist Party
of the Russian Federation won 157 of the 450-seat State Duma, the
lower house of the parliament, and later the position of Duma
speaker.
</P>
<P>
"It (Kohl's visit) is a recognition of his (Yeltsin's) status
as an international statesman -- a status that none of his rivals
can boast," said an anonymous Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of
the parliament, said on Tuesday that Kohl is an experienced and
one of the most gifted politicians in the world, and his visit can
support anyone.
</P>
<P>
"Far from everybody in Germany backed Kohl's visit to Moscow,"
Foreign Minister Primakov pointed out on the same day. "But the
timing of the trip and the visit itself underscore Helmut Kohl's
support to President Boris Yeltsin in his election campaign."
</P>
<P>
Other sources said Kohl's meeting with Yeltsin also touched on
the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
planned eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We (Russians) say firmly and toughly that we are against the
expansion of NATO toward Russia's borders," Yeltsin said. "Helmut,
my dear friend, he thinks that for now this problem needs to be
postponed for a long time and not talked about at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, while insisting that Russia had no right of veto over the
NATO's admission of new members, said Russia's security concerns
would be taken into account. "I am sure we will find a solution,"
he said. "But certainly not now."
