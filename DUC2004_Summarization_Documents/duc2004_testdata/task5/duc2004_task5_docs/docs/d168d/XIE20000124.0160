<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister Denies Alleged Elf Affair With Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Monday that he knew nothing about the allegation that
French oil group Elf-Aquitaine financed the election campaign of
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During a dinner with the press in Brussels, Vedrine said he
does not have any information on this subject, Agence France-
Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is a German affair of financing political party, and
Helmut was a great chancellor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German television ARD and French television France 2 quoted
an unnamed acquaintance of former French President Francois
Mitterrand as saying that Mitterrand wanted to help his friend
Kohl win the election and ordered Elf to pay part of his campaign
costs.
</P>
<P>
The report said Elf paid Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
43.6 million euros (about 43.6 million U.S. dollars) in commission
when it bought the Leuna Oil and Chemical Refinery company in
former East Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The CDU used 15.4 million euros of the commission in its 1994
election campaign, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has categorically denied the report, calling it "an appeal
for political murder."
