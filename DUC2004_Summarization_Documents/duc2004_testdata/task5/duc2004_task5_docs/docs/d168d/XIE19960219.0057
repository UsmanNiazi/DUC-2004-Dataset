<TEXT>

MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today told visiting Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl that Russia is
and will continue to be firmly opposed to the eastward expansion
of NATO towards its borders.
</P>
<P>
After two-and-a-half hours of talks with Kohl in the Kremlin
this morning, Yeltsin told reporters: "My friend Helmut believes
that a solution to the problem should be postponed for a while and
be passed over in silence for people to cease worrying."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived here Sunday night for a three-day official
visit, told reporters that he will not pursue a policy which could
put under threat the new partnership and friendly relations
between Russia and Germany.

<P>
The German leader said that the establishment of a
pan-European security system could be one of the possible
solutions to the problem of NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
"One should act so as to prevent the emergence of new barriers
in Europe. It is essential to handle these issues in a calm and
reasonable manner," Kohl added.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is expected to have talks with Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
this afternoon.
</P>

Yeltsin will give an official dinner in the Kremlin in Kohl's
honor this evening.
