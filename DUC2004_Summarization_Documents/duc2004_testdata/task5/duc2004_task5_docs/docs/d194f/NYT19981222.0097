<P>
   Remember the ``Crash of 98?'' Neither did I _ so much else has
happened recently. So I went back to see what the business
magazines had to say after the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
512 points on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, I was interested in the circumstances in which
hedge fund proprieter George Soros closed up his new pronunciamento
``The Crisis of Global Capitalism.'' As he says in the preface, it
is ``an instant book'' prepared in the aftermath of the collapse of
the Russian ruble. Fortune's ``Crash of 98'' cover in September led
off with Joe Nocera's ``Requiem for the Bull.'' (``One it looked as
if the miracle market could go on forever.'')
</P>
<P>
   Forbes posed the question _ 1929? or 1987? _ but didn't dare to
make a call, leaving it to ten columnists to go their separate
ways. (Applied economist Steve H. Hanke wrote, ``Russia doesn't
much matter? It may be a small economy, but so was Austria when, in
the 1930s, its Creditanstalt failed, taking down much of Europe's
banking system . . . '' Business Week, as usual, trumpeted on its
cover ``Time to act!''
</P>
<P>
   None reckoned on what has happened since. It took nearly two
years after 1987 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 to regain its
previous peak; this time it required just four months _ the
shortest recovery of any major correction according to David Wyss
of Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, too, clearly was counting on a stormier mood than today
exists when he told a congressional committee on Sept. 15: ``The
global capitalist system which has been responsible for the
remarkable prosperity of this country in the last decade is coming
apart at the seams.'' (The testimony is quoted for six pages in the
book.)
</P>
<P>
   Soros, 68, is an extraordinarily successful speculator in
foreign currencies. His personal worth is said to be about $5
billion. He has made many billions more for investors in his
Quantum fund, one of the world's largest hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Soros hasn't actively managed Quantum since 1989. Instead,
he entrusts the task to a battery of talented subordinates. During
a book tour interview with Clay Harris and Norma Cohen of the
Financial Times, Soros put it this way: ``I think that I've lost
it. I'm like an overaged ballet dancer. I just haven't got what it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in anticipation of this moment, Soros for years has been
positioning himself as an elder statesman of finance. But if he's a
money management has-been, he's a never-was as an analyst of
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier book, ``The Alchemy of Finance,'' postulated a
universal principle of ``reflexivity:'' namely, that received
opinions have a way of turning back on themselves, as mavericks
outguess the herd.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Soros letter to the Financial Times in August that was
widely viewed as having been a contributing factor to the Russian
crisis, which boiled over when the government defaulted on some of
its bonds. His new book offers a blow-by-blow account. He was at
the time Russia's single biggest investor _ a role which was not
widely understood as he offered his advice.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Soros proposes an
international credit insurance company, to guarantee the debts of
emerging nations to investors like him. ``He's like Robert
McNamara, after he had screwed up Vietnam,'' says Peter Brooke, the
international venture capitalist based in Boston. ``First you get
this grandiose technological offensive. When that doesn't work you
get this great mea culpa.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, one thing at which Soros is indisputably good is giving
his money away. A network of foundations in Eastern Europe are
noted for their modest but quick and highly effective bequests _
such as the underground elctrical power plant that kept the city of
Sarajevo running during its siege.
</P>
<P>
   You can chart Soros' reputation as a guru, however, on the media
bourse. His first book was excerpted in the Financial Times. This
time it was Newsweek. Next? Maybe the Drudge Report.
