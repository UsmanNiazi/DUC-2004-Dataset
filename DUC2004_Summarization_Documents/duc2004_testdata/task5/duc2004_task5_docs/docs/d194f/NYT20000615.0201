NEW HEDGE FUND WILL SEEK LOWER RETURNS, SOROS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON _ Insisting that he plans to withdraw from hands-on
management of his huge hedge funds, which once swung the world's
markets, George Soros said Thursday that a $6.5 billion fund to be
introduced next month would seek lower returns and be run in part
by outside money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, whose Quantum Fund has been hit by the resignations of
top managers and a flight of investors' cash, told reporters here
that his Quantum Emerging Growth Fund would be merged with the
Quantum Fund on July 1 to create the Quantum Endowment Fund. He
described it in a letter to shareholders as ``a structure that will
last beyond my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new fund would be less leveraged than the Quantum
Fund in its heyday, when Soros, the Hungarian-born financier,
became known for coups like betting against the pound during the
1992 British financial crisis. The move reportedly netted Soros $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement comes after weeks of turmoil that began
when two senior managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas
Roditi, left in April. Since March, assets in Soros' funds have
dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion as investors withdrew and
technology stocks fell. ``The bubble has been pricked,'' Soros
said, referring to so-called new-economy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Soros' funds have averaged 32 percent returns by
making big, leveraged plays on bonds, commodities, currencies and
stocks. He said his new fund would rely less on borrowed money than
in the past. ``In my old age I have become conservative,'' Soros,
69, told reporters here. ``I'll be happy if I average 15 percent
rather than 31 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros indicated that, as he pulled back from day-to-day
management to concentrate on philanthropic funds, his 36-year-old
son, Robert, would adopt an increasingly central role in the
family's financial empire. ``It would be a big mistake for me to go
back into the ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soros said he would put more of his money into more stable real
estate and private equity. And, he said, roughly half of the assets
in the reorganized fund would be managed by up to 20 outsiders. The
portfolio will be spread over real estate, ``macro'' bets using
less borrowed money, private equity and stocks, which will account
for half of the fund's assets, he said. The change will mean that
about 100 Quantum Fund traders and money managers will lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reorganization is almost done,'' Soros said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have led some analysts to conclude that the Quantum
Fund is far more a personal investment vehicle than in the past.
Soros acknowledged that ``outside money is probably less than 40
percent'' and said the reorganized fund ``fits my personal needs
better than the previous one.'' &QL;
