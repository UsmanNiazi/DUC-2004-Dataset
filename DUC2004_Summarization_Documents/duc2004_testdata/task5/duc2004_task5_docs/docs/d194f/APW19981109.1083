Soros says United States opposes international cooperation
</HEADLINE>

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ U.S. billionaire financier George Soros
chided Monday his government for obstructing international
cooperation by refusing to support setting up an international
criminal court.
	   ``The United States is the greatest opponent of international
cooperation,'' said Soros, who is Hungarian-born, during a lecture
in the Bulgarian capital.
	   ``The U.S., China, Israel, Yemen and Iraq voted against the
international criminal court. It's a very good company,'' he added.
``The United States has to reconsider its policy to international
cooperation.''
	   Soros runs a pro-democracy fund named ``Open Society,'' which
advocates acceptance of universal values of free market and
democracy across the world. The fund supports developmet of
western-style civil societies in the emerging democracies of the
former Soviet bloc.
	   ``Open society can be endangered by an excessive reliance on
market ... by the belief that markets can take care of everything.
I think that it is a false idea,'' he said.
	   Soros said unpredictability of global fiancial markets was at
the core of the Asian economic meltdown. ``Financial markets are
inherently unstable and instability can cause a tremendous
damage,'' he said.
	   Soros added there was ``a moral hazard'' in tackling the world
financial crisis by lowering interest rates in the United States
and raising them in Asian economies.
	   ``There is an asymmetry in the treatment of debtors and
creditors which is described as a moral hazard...This will have to
be corrected,'' he said.
	   He also dismissed calls to abolish the International Monetary
Fund, but said it needed to be reformed.
	   ``The IMF has been more interested in saving the global banking
system than the countries which have been in trouble,'' Soros said.
