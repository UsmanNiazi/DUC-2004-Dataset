<P>
   NEW YORK _ What would Freud have made of the way George Soros,
the world's most famous hedge fund manager, describes the tension
brought on by having made a fortune as a speculator and then having
reinvented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I felt like a gigantic digestive tract, taking in
money at one end and pushing it out at the other,'' Soros writes
earthily in the preface to his new book, ``The Crisis of Global
Capitalism'' (Public Affairs, $26). ``But in fact a considerable
amount of thought connected the two ends.''
</P>
<P>
   And what to make of a man who has raked in billions of dollars
through lightning strikes in free-wheeling currency markets, but
now advises the world on how to clean up the messes he thinks such
strikes create?
</P>
<P>
   While Soros has been playing the multiple roles of trader,
philosopher and philanthropist for many years, the friction has
come into sharpest relief in recent months, as he has boldly
prescribed cures for a variety of the world's economic ills.
</P>
<P>
   It has been most conspicuous in Russia, where Soros, with more
than $1 billion at stake in the country, actively lobbied Russian
and American officials to accept his advice on the best way to
resolve the summer's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Soros' book includes a day-by-day account of his high-level
phone contacts and memo-writing in the weeks before and after the
August devaluation of Russia's currency, the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential conflict _ I've always taken great care
not to exploit it,'' said Soros, 68, gently tapping his eyeglasses
against a conference table in his mid-Manhattan office. ``And I
think that people, both in Russia and Washington, knew that, and
that's why they took the calls, because I think I have established
a certain record in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many observers wonder about Soros' straddling of so many
fences in the worlds of finance, economics and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a built-in conflict between making money in
public markets and improving the world,'' said James Grant, editor
of a newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, and the author of
several studies of financial markets. ``Soros is out there telling
you what he's done, what he's going to do and how he'll save the
world. I think there's a conflict because those goals seem at
cross-purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises questions about inside information when you're able
to talk to central bankers and policy makers at the same time that
you're involved in financial markets,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Soros, dapper and attentive, defended his probity
in a wide-ranging interview last week, saying he has always strived
to keep separate his roles as a hard-nosed trader placing global
bets and a financial guru able to rub elbows with the highest of
the high and mighty.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had run-ins with American regulators in the 1970s and
80s, he has never been accused of insider trading or similar
financial wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to distinguish between playing by the rules and making
the rules,'' Soros said. ``Playing by the rules, one does the best
one can, irrespective of the social consequences. Whereas in making
the rules, people ought to be concerned with the social
consequences and not with their personal interests _ in other
words, not to bend the rules to their benefit or their advantage.
This is a principle which I have certainly observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Soros, who is believed to be worth about $5 billion, is
uniquely positioned to help determine how the rules are made in
some parts of the world, and he built his fortune in currency
markets where the rules were never entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian crisis mounted in August, for example, Soros
worked his Rolodex, summoning influential Russian politicians and
United States Treasury Department officials to the telephone. He
pushed for a big international bailout and a devaluation of the
ruble to bolster Russia's troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Soros had $1 billion invested in a Russian
telecommunications concern _ through a partnership with one of
Russia's powerful ``oligarchs'' _ as well as investments in Russian
stocks, bonds and the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Soros was also the overseer of a philanthropic foundation in
Moscow that generously financed a range of causes, including
education, the arts, sciences and media, through about $61 million
in annual grants.
</P>
<P>
   If Soros ruled the world, he said, he would establish an
international regulatory agency to rein in speculative excesses and
provide financing during economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it bluntly, the choice confronting us is whether we
will regulate global financial markets internationally, or leave it
to each individual state to protect its own interests,'' he wrote
in his book. ``The latter course will surely lead to the breakdown
of the gigantic circulatory system which goes under the name of
global capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   That prescription reflects the fact that Soros has long harbored
a certain disdain for the profession that made him rich. Indeed,
his record is such that he _ along with Warren E. Buffett, the
Omaha financier, and perhaps Peter Lynch, the Fidelity fund guru _
is among the few investors whose names are widely recognized by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   A Hungarian-born Jew, Soros was 14 when the Nazis invaded his
homeland. He avoided the fate of many Jews by posing as the godson
of a Hungarian official overseeing the confiscation of Jewish
properties. He moved to London after the war and eventually
graduated from the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   There he came under the influence of the philosopher Karl
Popper, whose ``open societies'' credo Soros re-fashioned as his
own. Popper opposed totalitarian states; Soros believes that
participatory democracy and regulated market economies are the
vehicles for insuring individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   His academic training led to the fascination with abstract
thinking that pervades much of his writing. ``But if you get too
abstract, you have nothing to grapple with and abstraction empties
your thinking of content,'' he acknowledged last week.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, at first hard up for cash and then stymied by limited
opportunities in London, moved to New York in the late 1950s and
became a trader. He soon carved out a niche exploiting differences
between the London and New York markets, a gulch he mined through
the 60s before venturing into the new world of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds _ largely unregulated investment pools open only to
wealthy investors and big institutions _ aim to provide
consistently outsized returns on stocks, bonds, currencies or other
securities while limiting losses from market downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, an aggressive, gutsy speculator, ran one of the earliest
and most successful of these _ the Quantum Fund _ for two decades
beginning in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Basing Quantum in the loosely regulated confines of the
Caribbean island of Curacao, Soros often racked up returns in
excess of 30 percent a year and twice posted annual returns of more
than 100 percent, according to the fund's most recent quarterly
report.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the first investors to hunt down opportunities
around the world, eventually spawning a legion of imitators and
fellow enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``George opened all of our thinking to macroeconomic theory, and
he made globalists of us all by making us understand the importance
of geopolitical events on the U.S. economy,'' said Byron Wien,
chief domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
who has known Soros for about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Soros gave up day-to-day management of Quantum in 1989, but he
is still consulted on major trades and is one of three supervisors
of Soros Fund Management, the New York firm that oversees Quantum
and his other funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s he has also been a ubiquitous
philanthropist, donating money to causes around the globe to
realize his vision of an open society. Last year, his foundations
gave away $428 million, with Russia the single largest recipient
and political reform in Eastern Europe one of his chief causes.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Soros has become an incisive critic of the
predations of unfettered capitalism, a theme that has taken on even
greater resonance in the wake of the financial calamities in Asia
and Eastern Europe over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets basically are amoral, whereas society does need some
kind of morality _ a distinction between right and wrong,'' Soros
observed. ``And by allowing market values to become all-important,
we actually narrow the space for moral judgment and undermine
public morality. This has actually happened, and globalization has
increased this aberration, because it has actually reduced the
power of individual states to determine their destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one in the markets proves the point better than
Soros himself. It was in 1992 that he became a household name, when
Quantum and related funds, largely using piles of borrowed money,
made more than $1 billion in a few weeks by betting against the
British pound.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's central bank wasted its reserves in an unsuccessful
effort to defend the currency's value. The episode derailed
Britain's membership in a European initiative seeking to
rationalize exchange rates _ and it earned Soros this sobriquet:
``the man who broke the Bank of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros has also described some forms of financial derivatives _
highly volatile and complex investing products _ as the economic
equivalent of crack cocaine. Yet he has used derivatives in his own
speculating, explaining that his funds favor only the simplest
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Such inconsistencies give pause to those who might otherwise
share his views. ``It's an amusing spectacle to see a guy like him
who's made a fortune speculating now going around denouncing
newcomers to the field,'' said Doug Henwood, author of ``Wall
Street'' (Verso, $25), an examination of financial markets. ``It's
like he suddenly found religion late in life and now wants to be
Hegel in a hedge fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Closet Hegel or not, Soros is still very much a market maven,
intimately involved in his hedge funds' overall activities. That
has created some notable flare-ups in the last year, as politicians
and financiers alike grappled with understanding the causes of the
recent wave of global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, the finger has been pointed at speculators.
Developing nations that had welcomed the capital of foreign
investors when it flowed into their economies decried ``hot money''
as it whipped out.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators like Soros were blamed for destabilizing one nation
after another that lacked the financial resources to defend their
currencies when signs of economic weakness drew traders' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Soros' funds were shorting Thailand's currency,
the baht, and Malaysia's currency, the ringgit _ that is, betting
that the value of both currencies would drop.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Thailand dropped its defenses, devaluing the baht. That
set off the wave of devaluations in Malaysia and elsewhere that
marked the beginning of the current global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Soros said that by the time of the devaluations, his funds had
become active buyers of the currencies, believing that they had
already hit bottom. But that did not shield him from withering
accusations, mainly from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews robbed the Palestinians of everything, but in
Malaysia they could not do so, hence they do this _ depress the
ringgit,'' Mahathir said in blaming Soros and other currency
traders for Malaysia's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Washington on Thursday, Soros criticized Mahathir
and his policies. ``He needs to be removed from power,'' Soros
said.
</P>
<P>
   SOROS' manifold roles on the world stage became most apparent in
August, during the Russian economic meltdown, when he leaped into
the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had a longstanding interest in Russia _ inspired by
his father's time there as a prisoner of war, followed by a brief
residency, during and after World War I _ Soros said he had steered
clear of investing there in the years immediately after the fall of
communism. Rather, he sank money into the country through
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abstained from investing in Russia,'' Soros wrote in his new
book, ``partly to avoid any conflict-of-interest problems but
mainly because I did not like what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   But as early as 1994, he had been in and out of Russia as an
investor. And in 1997, he plunged headlong into Russian markets
when they were among the frothiest on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Soros explains now that his concerns about the country were
allayed by his confidence in the young reformers surrounding
President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But his largest single holding in Russia _ a $1 billion stake in
Svyazinvest, a telecommunications concern _ put him into
partnership with Vladimir Potanin, the young chairman of one of
Russia's biggest banks. Potanin is a member of a powerful and
politically influential clique of Russian businessmen known as the
``oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These men deftly exploited lucrative opportunities that came
with privatization in Russia and used dubious tactics to snare
control of huge industrial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it on the thesis that robber capitalism was ready to
turn into legitimate capitalism,'' Soros said of his holding in
Svyazinvest.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition proved bumpy. In March, Soros lent the
Russian government several hundred million dollars to help it meet
overdue pension payments. By the summer, as a corrupt and
debt-ridden economy was tumbling toward insolvency, Soros was
Russia's biggest individual investor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his investment with Potanin _ which he now describes as
the worst of his career _ he also held Russian stocks, bonds and
rubles.
</P>
<P>
   All of this hardly made Soros a disinterested observer when he
sprang into action in mid-August to try to stem the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to the account in his book, Soros contacted both
Robert E. Rubin, the American Treasury secretary, and David A.
Lipton, an under secretary who has since left the Treasury
Department. He also telephoned two influential former members of
Yeltsin's administration, Yegor T. Gaidar and Anatoly B. Chubais,
to lobby them on how to prevent an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Soros published a letter in The
Financial Times saying that the meltdown in the Russian financial
markets had ``reached the terminal phase.'' He called for immediate
action, including a devaluation and the institution of a currency
board _ a system fixing a nation's currency to the value of its
richest trading partner. Such a plan would have taken away Russian
central bankers' discretion over monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter helped prompt a panic in Russian markets _ and
invited a fresh bout of suspicion about Soros' motives. Later in
the day, he issued a statement saying that he was not shorting the
ruble, adding that his own portfolio ``would be hurt by any
devaluation.'' In his book, he added that he did not trade any
Russian securities during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, Russia appeared headed for a default on its
foreign and domestic debt. In a private meeting in Russia's White
House on Sunday, Aug. 16, business leaders _ including Potanin _
persuaded members of the Yeltsin administration to add a moratorium
on debt repayment to a deep devaluation of the ruble that was to be
announced the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement caused international investors to flee Russia,
touching off a global financial panic and setting in motion the
events that would lead, a month later, to the near-collapse and
government-orchestrated bailout of another big hedge fund,
Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Soros says self-interest played no part in his financial
diplomacy during the meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, of course, I had been very involved and became more
involved at the time of the crisis,'' he said last week. ``But the
advice that I gave, which I think would have avoided the breakdown,
was not designed to benefit me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the end of August, Soros' funds announced a $2
billion loss in Russia. But it is hard to imagine that the
country's economic stabilization _ the goal of his activism _ could
have failed to bolster Svyazinvest.
</P>
<P>
   Ever philosophical, Soros acknowledges that his foray into
Russia was problematic. ``I have no regrets with regard to my
attempts to help Russia move toward an open society: They did not
succeed, but at least I tried,'' he wrote in his book. ``I have
grave regrets as an investor. It goes to show how difficult it is
to reconcile the two roles.''
</P>
<P>
   But a former American official who has crossed paths with Soros
said the speculator's many roles made it hard to weigh his advice.
``The fact that one part of him is motivated by the philanthropy
and another part by the investments makes it very difficult to deal
with him,'' said the former official, who insisted on anonymity.
``Sometimes the philanthropy dominates his motives. Sometimes
investing does. But there's that duality, and you never know.''
