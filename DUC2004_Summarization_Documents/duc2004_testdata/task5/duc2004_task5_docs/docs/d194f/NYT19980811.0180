<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Billionaire philanthropist George Soros is trying
to get around one of the governor's budget vetoes to share some of
his wealth with the state to fund after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, who is committed to finding ways to keep young people
occupied a few hours a day after school, planned on giving New York
state $3.33 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soros wanted to give a dollar for every $3 in government funding
for after-school programs, said Vincent Marrone, government
relations director for The After School Corp., the New York City
financier's not-for-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   However, that plan to partially match state funding got dashed
when Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, vetoed $10 million in
after-school funding approved by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost free money,'' said Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan,
chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. ``I think that the
governor's veto demonstrated, incredibly, short-sightedness and bad
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who liked the after-school program concept, provided $1
million in his budget plan in January for ``Advantage Schools,'' a
new after-school program that he promised to fund with $10 million
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the program would bring together schools,
parents and community organizations to provide a secure and
enriching environment for children before parents are home from
work. He planned to tap philanthropic funds from Soros to build the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, however, vetoed the $10 million along with $750
million in what he called ``new, unnecessary spending.'' Alan Ray,
an Education Department spokesman, said his department has provided
$5 million for after-school programs in recent years. This year, he
said, the budget increased to $15 million with 80 percent of the
increase available for school districts and 20 percent available to
community-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The money is available on a competitive basis and the criteria
for eligibility are weighted toward neediest districts and neediest
students.
</P>
<P>
   Soros wants to fund only programs in schools aided with public
money that offer structured activities in academic, athletic,
recreational, art, music, drama and other areas of educational and
cultural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Marrone said he was working with the state Office of Child and
Family Services in attempts to match its $500,000 budget for
after-school programs with about $166,666.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for as many places as we can to partner,''
Marrone said, adding that New York City schools will receive about
$3 million to match $9 million in public commitment.
