LAST MANAGER SET TO LEAVE SOROS FUND 
</HEADLINE>

   The last of three top money managers announced his departure on
Thursday from the dwindling investment empire of George Soros.
Scott Bessent, who oversees European investments for Soros Fund
Management, said he would leave to start his own private investment
group.
</P>
<P>
   The move lowers the curtain on Soros' run as one of the world's
most daring money managers. In late April, after sustaining bracing
losses, Soros, 69, said he would reorganize his investment group
and abandon many of the risky strategies that made him a
multibillionaire. But it was unclear then just how thorough an
overhaul his firm would undertake.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the extent of the transformation was apparent.
Bessent, 37, the last of the money managers that oversaw Soros Fund
Management's global investment strategies, will take nine Soros
staff members with him to his new firm. The other top managers,
Stanley F. Druckenmiller and S. Nicholas Roditi, announced their
retirements in late April, after the firm's flagship Quantum Fund
had fallen 22 percent through the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   All three executives will depart at the end of the month and
will not be replaced. Instead, Soros will reduce his staff and farm
out much of the management of his fund group to outside managers
like Bessent, in an attempt to greatly reduce risk and make his
investment group a more suitable launching pad for his charitable
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors, preferring the old Soros to the new, tamer
Soros, have withdrawn their money. Because of withdrawals and
performance setbacks, assets in the five Soros funds currently
stand at $13.3 billion, down from $17 billion at the end of last
year. In addition, Duncan Hennes, the chief executive of Soros Fund
Management who indicated in April that he would stay on to help
rebuild, said last week that he would also depart at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The departures and the more conservative philosophy will leave
Soros Fund Management a much different organization from the one
that managed over $22 billion in 1998 and rattled markets with big
bets on the directions of global currencies, stocks and bonds.
Soros was nicknamed ``the man who broke the pound'' in 1992 for
betting millions of dollars against the British pound, but Bessent
wrote in a recent letter to friends and associates that the
environment that made these so-called ``macro'' strategies
successful in the past had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Both a Soros spokesman and Bessent said his departure was
amicable. Bessent will use $150 million of his own money to start
two private funds, and Soros will add another $150 million. Bessent
said he would keep some of his own money in Soros' $3.5 billion
venture capital fund and sit on a Soros advisory board.
