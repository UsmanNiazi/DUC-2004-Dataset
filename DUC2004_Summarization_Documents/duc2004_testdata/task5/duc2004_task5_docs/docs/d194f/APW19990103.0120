<HEADLINE> Report: Soros Urges IMF Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund should be  
transformed into a global central bank to help prevent new 
financial crises from wrecking economies around the world, American 
financier George Soros said Monday in the London-based Financial 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Markets can move like a wrecking ball, knocking over one  
economy after another,'' Soros said in an op-ed article. ``The 
swings cannot be avoided altogether, but they need to be brought 
under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes to the IMF were necessary because it had become ``part  
of the problem rather than the solution.'' But he strongly 
disagreed with those calling for the IMF's abolition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If global financial markets are inherently unstable we need a  
stronger regulatory framework rather than the dismantling of 
existing institutions,'' Soros wrote. ``To be specific, we need to 
convert the IMF into something resembling an international central 
bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soros said the IMF should act as lender of last resort, and only  
for ``a select group of countries that are eager to obtain such 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the countries would have to maintain sound economic  
and banking policies. Countries which failed to meet those 
conditions would continue to have access to the IMF on terms 
similar to those which currently are available. But in a crisis, 
the IMF would be allowed to impose conditions not only on the 
country involved but also on the creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Soros said that would eliminate the ``current imbalance in favor  
of creditors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major criticisms of the billion-dollar IMF rescue  
packages for Asia and Russia in the past year was that much of the 
money went to bail out international bankers who made bad 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management, runs the $20 billion  
Quantum group of hedge funds, which were rattled by the turbulent 
global economy last year.
