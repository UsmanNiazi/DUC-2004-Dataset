<P>
 Action As A Crime
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today rapped the United States for refusing to
regard the currency manipulations of billionaire financier George
Soros, who is responsible for the dwindling of ASEAN currencies,
as a crime because it is not a victim of Soros' actions.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said Malaysia and the affected countries
would take the necessary steps to consider Soros' actions as a
crime because "if we keep quiet, the United States will continue
to legalese his currency manipulations."
</P>
<P>
Soros' actions are considered as a crime as it had affected
many poor people who have become victims unlike the rich who
remained untouched," Mahathir said at a dialogue session with the
participants of an international conference on regional Muslims
and the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On his return from a two-month leave abroad last month,
Mahathir named Soros as the man responsible for the dwindling
value of the Malaysian Ringgit, Thailand Baht, Philippine Peso
and Indonesian Rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia, in collaboration with other countries,
would try to solve the problem and to regard Soros' currency
manipulations as an international crime.
</P>
<P>
"If we regard Soros' actions as a crime, we can take action.
We, who have become his victims, must cooperate to overcome it and
make it a crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Soros' manipulations had affected 10 per cent of
Malaysia's and 20 per cent of Indonesia's economy.
