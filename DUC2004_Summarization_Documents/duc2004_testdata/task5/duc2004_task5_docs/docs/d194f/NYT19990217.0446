COLUMNIST BACKS OFF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SOROS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When the legendary speculator George Soros speaks, financial
markets move.
</P>
<P>
   When financial markets tumble, politicians and central bankers
look to Soros for advice.
</P>
<P>
   And when the noted economist and columnist Paul Krugman
suggested last week that Soros had taken advantage of his
privileged position and engaged in a bit of insider trading, the
global gossip mill began churning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Krugman now admits, is that his charges are not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I allowed myself to serve as a conduit to the media for this
story, and I shouldn't have done that,'' Krugman said in an
interview Wednesday. ``I'm a believer that these things happen, but
I don't know what actually happened and I shouldn't have conveyed
that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   As Krugman beats a hasty retreat from the allegations he made
last week against Soros in the online magazine Slate, the episode
shows the perils of leveling insider-trading charges against any
financier, especially when it involves one of the most well-known
members of the very clubby, and very cloistered, world of
international finance.
</P>
<P>
   Insider trading is, of course, extremely hard to prove. Soros,
who declined to comment Wednesday, has never been charged with
insider trading during more than three decades plying the world's
financial markets, most notably as a currency trader.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Soros' hedge fund firm, Soros Fund Management,
also declined to comment, other than to point out several
retractions Krugman has posted on his personal Web site and to
share a letter the firm sent to Slate _ which is owned by Microsoft
Corp. _ requesting that those retractions be noted.
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha, which has also erupted in the Brazilian media,
began with Krugman's Feb. 11 Slate column in which the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist wrote that Soros
used information gleaned from a former employee, Arminio Fraga Neto
_ who is also the newly appointed Brazilian central bank president
_ to successfully speculate in Brazilian bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the days preceding the appointment of Arminio Fraga Neto,
a former fund manager for billionaire speculator George Soros, as
president of Brazil's central bank, wild rumors spread through the
markets: Brazil was going to default on its debt, close the banks,
whatever,'' Krugman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that time, it turns out, Fraga was negotiating with the
government, meaning he knew that no such plan was being devised. At
the same time, Soros was buying up large quantities of Brazilian
debt at deep discounts. When the weekend passed the real recovered
sharply, partly because Soros was now able to `squeeze' those who
had sold Brazilian debt short.''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman said in Wednesday's interview that his sources for the
information about Soros' Brazilian trades were ``e-mails from
people in the investment community.'' But Krugman, who also writes
for Fortune magazine, said he made no attempt to independently
verify his sources' contentions, nor did he attempt to seek comment
from Soros or anyone else at Soros' firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, I wish I hadn't done it,'' Krugman said. ``I didn't
think I was breaking a story. It's all been an object lesson in
something or other.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, the editor of Slate, said his magazine planned
to run a letter from Fraga as well as Krugman's retractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied with the result in this case, but we're
satisfied with the processes we have in place here to prevent these
things from happening,'' Kinsley said. ``We're not foolproof but we
have a pretty good record of accuracy.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite Krugman's self-described reporting errors, there is
little legal recourse for Soros given his notoriety and protections
the press receives under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soros is a public figure and as a result, if somebody writes
something about him that turns out to be false the writer is
protected so long as he believed in what he said at the time he
wrote the article,'' said Floyd Abrams, a lawyer specializing in
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not entirely clear what Soros' financial position
was in Brazil prior to Fraga's appointment. On Wednesday, the firm
declined to discuss its trading despite repeated requests to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, a former managing director with Soros Funds
Management who co-taught an international finance course with Fraga
at Columbia University, said he was recently assured by several
Soros employees that the firm received no inside information from
Fraga. Johnson said that these employees said that ``they missed
opportunities in Brazil'' to make money.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraga said he did not disclose to anyone at Soros'
firm that he was negotiating with the Brazilian government for the
central bank position until the day he resigned from the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil devalued its currency, the real, on Jan. 13, sending it
into a free fall from which it has yet to recover and raising
concerns about the capabilities of the Brazilian government's
economic team. A week later, on Jan. 20, the New York Federal
Reserve convened a breakfast meeting at its offices at the request
of the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians wanted to speak with a select group of financiers
about the prospects for the Brazilian economy, according to a
Federal Reserve spokesman. Among those invited to the breakfast
were Chase Manhattan's chairman, Walter Shipley; J.P. Morgan's
chairman, Douglas Warner; Citigroup's vice chairman, William
Rhodes; Merrill Lynch's chairman, David Komansky, and nine other
powerful financiers _ as well as Soros.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, on Jan. 27, Fraga, a former Brazilian central
bank official who was managing an emerging markets fund for the
Soros firm, met with Brazilian central bank officials but did not
discuss a job, Fraga said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga, who said he returned to New York the night of Jan. 28,
added that a Brazilian finance ministry official first explored the
possibility of the central bank presidency with him on Saturday,
Jan. 30. He was formally offered the job the next day and accepted.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at Soros' offices on Monday, Feb. 1, Fraga said
he resigned. He said no one at Soros Fund Management knew of the
negotiations before then, including Soros, who was at a financial
conference in Davos, Switzerland. Word of Fraga's appointment was
made public the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should be judged by rumors,'' Fraga said.
``Krugman wrote something based on rumors and his own
imagination.''
