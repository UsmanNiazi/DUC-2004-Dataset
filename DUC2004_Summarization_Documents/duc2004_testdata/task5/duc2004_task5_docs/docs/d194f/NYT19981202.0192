   NEW YORK _ George Soros, the greatest speculator of the age,
admitted in a book published worldwide Sunday that putting his
funds' money into Russia was ``the worst investment of my
professional career'' and warned that the world is heading into a
depression unless international finance is reformed soon.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Soros has put together
many of his observations of recent years in a book that amounts to
a wake-up call from a man who knows his subject firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   This year the value of the Soros funds dropped from about $22
billion to $18 billion _ half of the losses vanished in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the book consists of his diary of how he tried to
prevent the August financial meltdown in Moscow, an experience that
he concedes demonstrated to him the difficulty of reconciling his
role as an investor with his efforts to help make Russia a
democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks neither sympathy nor redress for his losses, only a new
and more stable order for global finance, despite the fact that
less volatility would mean fewer opportunities for speculators like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prevent the global capitalist system from destroying
itself,'' he writes. It is as if Joseph P. Kennedy had demanded
stock-market regulation during the Roaring Twenties _ or, if Soros
is right, just before the crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to an attack on what he calls the
dogma of ``market fundamentalism'' underlying the structure of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   At times he overstates the obvious, most notably in a lengthy
explanation of his favorite market theory of ``reflexivity,'' which
boils down to the observation that the thoughts and statements of
market players can affect the market.
</P>
<P>
   His definition of this unsurprising theory: ``Facts can be
influenced by making statements about them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when enough people chant the mantra of ``the magic
of the marketplace,'' Soros warns, this helps create the mass
delusion that the market solves all problems, whereupon people like
him bet that the herd will eventually stumble and he then picks up
the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He explains how his theories have helped make this contrarian
rich, but lest he give away Soros Fund Management's crown jewels,
he cites few examples beyond his already well-documented
billion-dollar profit on the 1992 fall of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In the present crisis, he argues that more information for
lenders is not sufficient because markets are inherently unstable _
and ``how much instability can society take?''
</P>
<P>
   Soros proposes a carrot-and-stick combination that would help
guarantee loans to countries that disclose their full balance
sheets and penalize banks that ignored warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the International Monetary Fund serve as the
multinational banks' debt collector from devastated borrowers in
the developing world, the banks would have to swallow some of their
losses by turning bad debts into equity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF's lending capacity would be increased
by issuing Special Drawing Rights to fill the financial hole
created by a default. The Special Drawing Right, or SDR, is an
artificial IMF reserve currency that central banks can cash in for
dollars and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   This complex plan would be institutionalized by an International
Credit Insurance Corporation with access to all information about
outstanding loans, public and private, carried by borrowers and
lenders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation would then decide what proportion of a loan to
guarantee at preferential interest rates. Foreign banks and
bondholders would be at risk for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that lenders could no longer count on IMF bailouts,
Soros argues, would put a powerful tool in the hands of the IMF and
``avoid excesses in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's publishing history demonstrates the public lack of
urgency about the problem. Originally contracted to Random House
for an advance of $50,000, a draft of the book was delivered this
summer to the publisher, which had recently been bought by
Bertelsmann AG of Germany. Soros urged Random House to move up the
publishing date from early 1999 to the autumn of this year.
</P>
<P>
   After Random House refused, the author went to PublicAffairs, a
small, new, and aggressive house, which shipped copies to U.S.
bookstores within two months of receiving his manuscript on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PublicAffairs sold the international rights for
$900,000, splitting the money in the traditional ratio of 75-25
between author and publisher in a financial coup worthy of, well,
George Soros. &QL;
