<HEADLINE> Nader Making Bid for White House  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Ralph Nader, it's try, try and try again.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer advocate who has made several bids for the White House called a
news conference today to announce another run as a candidate for the
presidential nomination of the environmentalist Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a lawyer who first gained prominence taking on the auto industry in
the 1960s, received less than 1 percent of the vote when he ran in 1996. He
spent less than $5,000, taking no contributions and personally financing his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Nader collected about 6,300 write-in votes in the New Hampshire
primary, sometimes drawing crowds that rivaled those of major-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who turns 66 this month, has fought for campaign finance reform,
environmental protection and fair trade, employing a network of nonprofit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He faces competition for the Green Party nomination from at least three
other candidates, including Jello Biafra, lead singer for The Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Nader often shows disdain for the political process and has suggested that
the Republicans and Democrats leave voters with a choice between ``Tweedle-Dum
and Tweedle-Dee.'' He thinks third parties offer voters an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third parties are getting more visible,'' Nader said in 1996. ``The
aggregate of their votes will begin to affect the margin of victory for the
major party candidates.''
