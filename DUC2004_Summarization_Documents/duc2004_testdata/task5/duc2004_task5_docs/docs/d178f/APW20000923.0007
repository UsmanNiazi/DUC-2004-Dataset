<HEADLINE> Nader Touts Agriculture Plan  </HEADLINE>

   MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP) -- More than 12,000 people filled the
Target Center sports arena Friday night, paying $7 each to hear
presidential hopeful Ralph Nader denounce the major party
candidates and call for social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the crowd was proof his candidacy should be taken
seriously -- and that he should be allowed to participate in debates
with Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the largest gathering of paying citizens of the entire
year,'' for a Nader event the Green Party candidate told the
raucous crowd, which shouted, whistled and waved placards that
said, ''Let Ralph debate!''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's running mate, Winona LaDuke -- who lives on the White
Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota -- spoke about generational
justice and the environment, and how she and Nader would make the
world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not be taken for granted, and we will vote,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Nader proposed shifting control of U.S.
agriculture away from corporate conglomerates and back toward the
family farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''By weakening the stranglehold agribusiness has on the food
industry, we will be able to increase farm gate prices and
competition, which will consequently reduce food costs for
consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader billed the Target Center event a ''super rally'' and hoped
it would draw a large audience to raise money and build support for
his inclusion in the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   His farm plan calls for stronger enforcement of antitrust laws,
prohibition of meatpacker ownership of livestock production
facilities and allowing American farmers to grow industrial hemp.
</P>
<P>
   Next to him on a table during a news conference sat a pile of
18,000 signatures of Minnesotans requesting that Nader be included
in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota stop was the second of four major rallies. The
first, in Portland, Ore., was nearly as large as Friday's event,
selling out with 10,000 tickets at $7 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Nader visited Minnesota, he held a smaller rally
at the University of Minnesota that drew a packed house of 1,400
and raised about $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual way for a presidential candidate to raise money,
but Nader says the rallies are the best way to show how serious he
is.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to demonstrate that we can draw far greater
audiences,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nader spoke, volunteers passed cardboard collection boxes
up and down the aisles of the crowded arena. At least two people
donated $1,000, and several others donated $500. Nearly everyone
seemed to donate something.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're gonna bang our spoons until we get Ralph in the
debates,'' shouted former talk show host Phil Donahue, who spoke
before Nader took the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nader cited Minnesota as an example of a state on the cutting
edge of what should be done to spur more voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   Three things -- debate access, public financing and same-day
voter registration -- helped Gov. Jesse Ventura get elected, and
Nader thinks those principles should be emulated by other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those three factors should be the law of the land,'' he said,
adding that ''campaign finance reform is the boulder on the highway
to justice.''
