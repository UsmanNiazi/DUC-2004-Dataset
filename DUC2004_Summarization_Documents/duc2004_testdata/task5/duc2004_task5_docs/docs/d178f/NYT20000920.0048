<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the film version of ``Camelot,'' the
inhumanly chaste and pure Sir Lancelot sadly asks for the truth
from King Arthur's ancient sidekick and mentor, Pellinore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I irritate you, don't I, Pellinore?'' Lancelot says. ``All
fanatics are irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this pithy sentiment last week as Ralph Nader
made his way up and down California in his Don Quixote quest for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as Nader has been part of the American public
consciousness, he has been a fanatic _ to many of us in the most
admirable, Latin-origin sense of the word: ``of a temple, hence
enthusiastic, inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   To big business, the unphilanthropic rich and to co-opted,
sell-out politicians, Nader has also fit the contemporary
definition of ``fanatic,'' as inscribed in Webster's New World
Dictionary: ``A person whose extreme zeal, piety, etc., goes beyond
what is reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the last few weeks, the National Organization for Women and
several minority advocacy groups have put themselves on Nader's
enemies list, not because he's unreasonably pious but because they
believe he's ``stuck in a time warp'' of consumer activism and thus
ignorant of their specific issues.)
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Green Party candidate looks on the horizon of
power, he sees deceit, corruption, greed, neglect, laziness and
hypocrisy. Forty years ago, it was the ``unsafe at any speed''
Chevrolet Corvair that caused Nader's blood to boil and his
activist's heart to leap. Today, it is pretty much life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's detractors have tried for eons to find the chink in his
armor. Nobody can be that committed, they reason, that selfless,
that outraged for that long.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Nader campaigned for president and refused to
disclose his personal income tax returns, his critics thought they
finally had him. He must be hiding something. Why else would he
want to keep his IRS forms a secret?
</P>
<P>
   As Nader's ready financial revelations have shown during this
campaign, his motives for keeping his tax returns to himself were
not about embarrassing off-shore accounts or fortunes amassed
through sweatshop labor.
</P>
<P>
   He just meant what he'd always said about privacy, that nobody
in a free democracy ought to be forced to show the rest of the
country his income tax forms. Not himself, not Bill Gates, not Joe
Sixpack, not even George W. Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nader told the San Francisco Examiner: ``I think because I am
such a public citizen, I don't have much of a private life. When
you fight General Motors, Exxon, corrupt government and all these
other things that beset our country, you tend to work weekends and
nights. So there isn't much to talk about. It's a rather dull
personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was for Sir Lancelot _ until Queen Guinevere saw him raise
one of her husband's knights from the dead, and promptly fell
head-over-heels in love.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, led to the mother of all extramarital affairs,
which led to a war, the end of the Round Table and of Guinevere's
life outside of a convent.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader would never have let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd have even noticed the queen's adoring, lustful glances,
he sure wouldn't have returned them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Your Highness,'' he would have said. ``I've just
launched an investigation into the shoddy construction materials
they use to build the serfs' huts, and I'm trying to keep a tally
of all the money the knights waste on those stupid jousting
contests, and Arthur has asked me to hammer out a fair and
equitable health care plan for everyone in his kingdom. I'm just
not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough, lonely job being a fanatic. But somebody has to do
it. Lucky for those who have always found him inspiring that Ralph
Nader still wants the work. May he irritate for another 40 years.
