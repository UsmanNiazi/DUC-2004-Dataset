 CALIFORNIA NURSES BACK DARK HORSE FOR PRESIDENT  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California's largest organization of nurses
endorsed Ralph Nader for president Wednesday, becoming the first
influential group to back the consumer advocate's dark horse
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The California Nurses Association (CNA), which has a long
history of endorsing Democratic candidates, praised Nader _ who is
running as a member of the Green Party _ for his support of
patients' rights and universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurses love Ralph,'' said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director
of the CNA, which has 31,000 members in over 100 hospital and
health agencies throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement underscores the potential for Nader to chip away
at support for Vice President Al Gore, who has alienated some core
Democratic voters _ particularly union members and liberals _ with
his enthusiasm for free trade and his incremental approach to
expanding health care.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nader's poll numbers barely register 5 percent
nationally, that is approximately the margin by which Gore trails
Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Few pollsters believe Nader is popular enough to alter the
election's outcome, but some analysts believe that the vote may be
close enough that a strong showing in a few key states could tip
the electoral balance in Bush's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who rails against the increasing domination of big
business in politics, received less than 2 percent of the vote
during a run for the presidency in 1996, in which he spent less
than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he says he will spend more than $5 million,
campaigning in all 50 states. He also said he is not bothered by
the prospect of taking votes away from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the central issue of corporate power,'' Nader said in an
interview, ``the only difference between Gore and Bush is the
velocity with which their foreheads hit the floor when corporations
knock on their door.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused both of ``sucking up to Silicon Valley,'' and said
they are ``competing for the presidency to see who will take the
marching orders from their corporate paymasters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't want to compete on the agenda that I'm running
on,'' Nader added, ``he has to incur the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gore campaign said the vice president also
supports universal health care, but believes a more realistic way
to achieve it is by starting with guaranteed coverage for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take any votes for granted, but we aren't really
concerned about a Nader insurgency,'' said Gore press secretary
Doug Hattaway. ``We are confident as people look at the record and
agenda of all the candidates, the smart vote _ especially for
people who care about health care _ is for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, acknowledging that the Gore camp does not seem to be
losing sleep over his candidacy, offered the following advice:
``Slumber on Al Gore. Slumber on.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' endorsement was announced Wednesday in Washington
before a banner that read, ``Rns for R.N. _ Nader for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader has proposed a nationalized health care plan similar to
that which now exists in Canada, in which the federal government
would make sure that identical benefits were available to rich and
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The program would be financed through a combination of payroll
taxes, a tax on stock transactions and a reduction in the health
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At at time when nearly 45 million Americans are uninsured,
Ralph Nader is the only candidate for president to stand for
universal health care, including a national health insurance plan
that guarantees access to full health care services for every man,
woman and child,'' said CNA president Kay McVay.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's candidacy has drawn support from some big name
entertainers _ including Paul Newman, Jackson Brown, Bonnie Raitt
and the Indigo Girls _ but the CNA endorsement is his first from an
independent organization, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic officials downplayed the chances of
Nader's candidacy having much impact in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Nader is very popular among the left,'' said Art Torres,
chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``But he's not popular
enough to sway an election one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the nurses' union expressed dismay at the
endorsement for a candidate who is given almost no chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Helen Thompson, a registered nurse
from Davis who is also a Democratic assemblywoman. ``I think its a
political and tactical mistake. It worries me. Any organization as
capable as the California Nurses Association ought to have taken
more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who is co-chair of a group called the California
Nurses for Gore, said the vice president has a proven record on
health care issues, while Nader ``has a lot of advocacy, but he
hasn't ever been elected to see it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Democratic Party spokesman Bob Mulholland: ``The vast
majority of nurses in California will be voting for Al Gore. Their
future is not with the Republican Party or with a college campus
lecturer.''
