<HEADLINE> Ralph Nader Campaigns in Kentucky  </HEADLINE>

   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A longtime advocate for the ''little guy''
with his focus on the perceived evils of corporate America, Ralph
Nader now has other targets in sight: the Republican and Democratic
parties as he runs for president under the Green Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people like to take on big guys,'' Nader said with a
smirk as he spoke to several hundred supporters Thursday at the
University of Kentucky's Singletary Center for the Arts. ''I like
to take on big guys. Big guys invigorate me. And they should
invigorate you.''
</P>
<P>
   His message was simple: Corporations and their lobbyists have
taken over the political system and it is up to citizens to return
the process to its grass-roots origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear so many people today say, 'I'm not into politics,'''
he said. ''Students, if you don't turn on to politics, politics is
going to turn on you. That's a lesson you may learn the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, ran for president in 1996, but appeared on fewer than
one-fourth of state ballots. He did not campaign or raise money and
attracted less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Nader's goal is to get the party on the ballot
in every state and pull more than 5 percent of the vote, which
would qualify him for millions in federal campaign funds. He
currently polls in single digits, along with Reform Party
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party currently is on the ballot in 13 states,
including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Nader promised to wage ''a campaign in every sense of the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   He is up against a handful of challengers for the Green Party
nomination, including Jello Biafra, former lead singer of the punk
rock band the Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton and Harvard, Nader is a lawyer and
author who has fought to bring progress and reform in the areas of
auto safety, worker rights and environmental preservation. In the
late 1960s, he organized citizen action teams around the country
known as ''Nader's Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said his platform will revolve around several issues,
including creating a universal health care system and destroying
corporate America's hold on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two-party system is crumbling. (Ross) Perot started that
crumble,'' he said. ''They are hollowed out and don't have much
basic grass-roots support. They're basically two parties with a lot
of money fighting against each other with 30-second electric combat
ads on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we are going to regain control of our political
institution is to help build a progressive political movement that
will break up the concentration of wealth and power -- a plutocracy
that reigns over our democracy,'' he added.
