   DENVER _ Jubilant Green Party members made consumer advocate
Ralph Nader their official nominee for president Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrived here the vote was but a formality, a fact
reflected in the final tally: Nader, introduced by radio
commentator Jim Hightower as ``the lanky, somewhat disheveled, and
always true embodiment of reform,'' won 295 votes. His two
competitors each won 10 votes.
</P>
<P>
   After Nader was installed as the nominee by unanimous
acclamation, and delegates cut loose some of the green, white, and
blue balloons overhead, organizers showed an edgy, fast-cut video
montage of moments from his 35-year career, which was overlaid with
dance music and bold graphics that read ``End Corporate Welfare''
and ``Consumers (EQ) Voters.'' The crowd cheered loudest for
footage of the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle last
fall. It was a sharp contrast to the long, low-key acceptance
speech that followed, which stretched on for almost two hours, and
was far more typical of Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 4 1/2 months,'' he told the 1,000 party members
in attendance, ``this campaign must challenge the campaigns of the
Bush and Gore duopoly in every locality by running with the people,
not as Bush and Gore do, parading around the country looking for
photo opportunities and staged events.'' That brought loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, has been campaigning for the nomination since March.
He has visited all 50 states, reintroducing himself to some who
might have forgotten him, and introducing himself to those too
young to remember the man who indicted General Motors's safety
record in his 1965 book, ``Unsafe at Any Speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been pushing his longtime principles: universal health
care, public financing of campaigns, and stronger labor laws, among
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is polling at about 4 percent nationally. In California,
his share jumps to 9 percent in some surveys. His profile has risen
higher in recent weeks after the United Auto Workers and the
Teamsters praised his stand on trade.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party politics have been mostly fractious until now. But
more state Green parties have joined the Association of State Green
Parties than ever before, said Tom Sevigny, cochairman of the
association. The convention brought together 313 delegates from 39
states. Another national organization of Green parties, Green
Parties USA, was also at the convention, but because that group
prefers direct action to electoral politics, its members did not
participate in the votes. On Friday night, delegates resolved that
the two Green organizations meet in the next two months to
negotiate and form one national organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has stayed away from internal politics and is not a member
of the party, preferring, he says, to concentrate on running for
office. But his success is also the party's: If he wins 5 percent
of the vote in November, the Greens will be eligible for federal
matching funds in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nader has attracted so much attention,'' said Stacey Cordiero,
cochairwoman of the Massachusetts Green Party. ``We're talking
about multiplying the size of our organization in a matter of
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Nader has the nomination, he and the party will turn
their energies to the presidential debates, the first of which will
be held Oct. 3 in Boston. Nader will not be included in the debates
unless he polls 15 percent or more nationally. Green Party members
have vowed to disrupt the debates if Nader is excluded.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference before the final vote, Nader was asked if
he was worried that his candidacy would take votes from Gore, and,
in a close race, hand the presidency to Bush. As usual, he scoffed
at the question, arguing that there was no difference between the
two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you ask Albert Gore, `Are you worried about
defeating Ralph Nader?' '' he said. He said the Texas governor's
ascension to the White House would be ``a do-nothing replacing a
do-little, Tweedledee replacing Tweedledum.''
