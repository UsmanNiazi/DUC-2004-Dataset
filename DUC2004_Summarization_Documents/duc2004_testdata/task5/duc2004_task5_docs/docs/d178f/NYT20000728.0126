<P>
   Ralph Nader has been mentioned as a presidential candidate in
each of the past four decades, but this year, at the age of 66, he
has finally taken to the campaign trail in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer advocate and Green Party candidate is campaigning
against what he calls a ``government by global corporations'' that
has warped American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In presidential preference polls, Nader shows up in single
digits. Still, some supporters of Democratic candidate Al Gore
worry that Nader will drain votes from the vice president,
ultimately helping Republican George W. Bush win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has scorn for both major parties, arguing relentlessly
that they have ``surrendered to large corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to pull the United States out of the World Trade
Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nader
would end what he calls the WTO's ``kangaroo courts'' and ``global
secrecy,'' and pledges to act against repressions by foreign
dictatorships ``that are the bottom line enhancers to U.S.
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who talks of `free trade' doesn't know what he or she
is talking about,'' Nader said in an interview. What is
impoverishing much of the world, he said, is ``corporate-managed
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-party campaigns in American politics often blossom in the
summer. They tend to wilt in the fall as voters look at the
consequences of their vote and want it to count in electing a
president.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is blooming at the moment, particularly in places across
the country with pockets of liberal voters. In Bellingham, Wash.,
activist Del Lowery recently called an organizational meeting for
Nader at the suggestion of Nader's state campaign. More than 100
people turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Hogan, chairman of the Western Washington University
political science department, wasn't surprised. He said there is a
deep reservoir of activists that Nader can tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a big Bill Bradley campaign up here, as well as a lot
of people for John McCain,'' Hogan said. ``We were a hotbed of
organization against the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Nader published a best-selling book, ``Unsafe at Any
Speed,'' that exposed safety problems with the Corvair, made by
General Motors. The automobile manufacturer responded by putting
private detectives on his tail. GM ultimately was forced to
apologize to Nader before a Senate committee, turning its worst
critic into a national folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   As the demanding parent of America's consumer movement, Nader
has been a public figure for a third of a century. He was on the
ballot in several states in 1996 _ he took 2.6 percent of
Washington's vote _ but Nader did not actively campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But this year he aims to raise $5 million and propel his way
into this fall's presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   A famously private man, Nader recently disclosed a net worth
wealth of $3.8 million _ much of it in technology stocks. Unlike
Gore and Bush, he refuses to release his income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Nader describes Thomas Jefferson as his model president, and his
campaign as a model of ``Jeffersonian democracy.'' He claims to be
courting support with a message that ``resonates with conservatives
as well as liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives like to have clean air and clean water like
anyone else,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find signs of Jefferson's less-government
philosophy, or anything conservative at all, in Nader's pledges or
the Greens' campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nader supports a federally financed universal health care system
and ``total public financing'' of campaigns. He speaks of
appropriating prime time hours from commercial TV stations to put
on public service programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens' platform is a curious combination of 1890s
monopoly-busting populism, 1930s-style protectionism and 1960s
social democracy, with calls for a cradle-to-grave welfare state
paid for by the well-off.
</P>
<P>
   The party's platform pledges a six-hour work day with no cut in
pay, along with one-year paid educational leave for every seven
years worked. Free child care would be provided, along with free
education through graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   Americans would get a guaranteed family income of at least
$26,000 per year for a parent with three children, with an extra
$3,250 per child.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform proposes a simple formula for how to pay for
all these benefits: ``Build into the progressive income tax a 100
percent tax on all income over 10 times the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greens make the Justice Department's anti-trust lawsuit
against Microsoft Corp. look like an act of pacifism. The platform
of Nader's party would ``require breakup of any firm with more than
10 percent market share unless it makes a compelling case every
five years in a public regulatory proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Nader taking support away from Gore in
California, Michigan, Oregon and other states. Bush supporters are
hard-put to restrain their glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three out of every four votes Ralph Nader is getting come from
Al Gore,'' a senior Bush adviser told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, a Gore
confidante, concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with Nader when I was on Senator (Warren) Magnuson's
staff,'' Dicks said, ``but I have to say that a vote for Ralph
Nader helps George W. Bush. People will just have to weigh the
consequences of throwing their votes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some long-committed liberals face a wrenching decision. They are
drawn to Nader but repelled at the prospect of helping bring about
a Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn. What I'm weighing is the potential damage with Bush
vs. the strength of message that Nader would send,'' said Seattle
City Councilman Nick Licata, a member of the local Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has little patience for those who would depict him as a
spoiler, or who say that his candidacy would lead to Bush-appointed
Supreme Court justices who would roll back abortion rights and
safeguards of individual liberties.
</P>
<P>
   He cited such progressive GOP Supreme Court appointees as Earl
Warren, William Brennan, Harry Blackmun and David Souter. ``Not
bad, and all (appointed by) Republicans,'' Nader noted.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that a flood of Nader votes would help the
Democrats regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lets just say I cost Al Gore the election because there is an
outpouring of progressive support for my candidacy,'' Nader said.
``The same logic means Dick Gephardt becomes speaker of the House.
Very few Green Party members are running for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be so bad for the Democrats, to control the
House. A Republican president could not do anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens argue that because corporations control both major
parties, causing the Democrats to lose an election makes no
difference in how the country fares. In recent months, however, TV
screens have carried a different message.
</P>
<P>
   Major corporate interests have taken to the airwaves with
denunciations of Clinton-Gore proposals. The Business Roundtable
has decried the administration's patients bill-of-rights
legislation. The pharmaceutical industry has blanketed the airwaves
with TV spots decrying proposed coverage of prescription drugs
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Nader scoffs at the apparent conflicts between the
administration and corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is never enough for big corporations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party can give corporations 90 percent of what
they want; they still want the 10 percent'' they don't have.
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes on. For many liberals, it centers on a choice of
dreams or what is achievable.
</P>
<P>
   In Bellingham, activist Lowery promises not to budge from Nader.
``I'm getting old,'' he said, ``and I should be able to vote for
somebody I like before I die.''
