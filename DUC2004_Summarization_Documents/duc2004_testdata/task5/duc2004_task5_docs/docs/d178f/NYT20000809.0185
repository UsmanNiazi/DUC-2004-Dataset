<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
is spoofing MasterCard commercials by claiming his bid to expose
corporate contributions to the major political parties is
``priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second Nader ad, made by the Minneapolis firm that
produced zany ads that boosted Jesse Ventura's successful bid to be
Minnesota governor in 1998, is airing this week in Los Angeles, New
York, San Francisco, Seattle and other major markets.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial pokes fun at Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore for accepting millions in special interest
donations, and concludes with a plea to include Nader in the
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   The ad begins to the tune of ``Hail to the Chief'' and shows
news clips of Bush and Gore attending campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000-a-plate,'' an
announcer says in a voice-over. ``Campaign ads filled with
half-truths: $10 million. Promises to special interest groups: over
$10 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the camera pans to Nader sifting through documents at a
desk. ``Finding out the truth: Priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial concludes with a montage of images of Nader over
the years as the announcer repeats the MasterCard slogan, ``There
are some things money can't buy.'' The announcer then
editorializes: ``Without Ralph Nader in the presidential debates,
the truth will come in last.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is the work of Minneapolis-based North Woods Advertising.
The firm created some of the most memorable commercials from
Ventura's race, including one featuring the former wrestler posed
like Rodin's famous statue of ``The Thinker,'' and another showing
an action figure of Ventura refusing campaign donations from ``evil
special interests man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hillsman, who produced the Nader spot, said the ad aimed to
get voters to pressure officials into allowing Nader into the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has refused to allow
Nader and the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan in the nationally
televised debates unless they can each win above 15 percent support
in national polls. In recent national polls, Nader registered about
5 percent and Buchanan much less.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people find out what's going on, they literally and
viscerally get angry,'' Hillsman said. ``We're trying to get them
to go to the Web site to find out more about this arbitrary
situation where the two parties have decided to shut out third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman would not specify the cost of the advertisement, except
to say, ``It's more than $100,000 and less than $5 million.'' The
commercials began running Sunday on cable and network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in Philadelphia during the Republican National
Convention, Nader denounced the GOP and Democratic conventions as
corporate-paid ``political orgies.'' He said at the time that the
national political conventions exclude most working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political carnival where the political powers shake
down the corporations and the corporations buy future political
favors,'' Nader said of the GOP convention, adding that it would be
the ``same in Los Angeles'' where the Democrats hold their
nominating convention beginning Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Nader gaining among liberal Democrats and
environmentalists, especially in key Western and Midwestern states.
He has picked up support from rank-and-file members of organized
labor who are upset over the Clinton administration's support for
normalized trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party hopes to have Nader on the ballot in 45 states
by election day, Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, best known as a consumer advocate who in the 1960s
tangled with General Motors over auto safety and later took on the
nursing home industry, ran a hapless campaign for president in
1996, registering less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he says he is serious. The campaign has
organizations on 600 campuses and plans to add 400 more this fall.
He said the campaign has raised more than $1 million and that he
has visited all 50 states.
