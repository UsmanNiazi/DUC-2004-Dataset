NADER FIRST TELEVISION AD POKES AT BIG PARTIES

   Ralph Nader unveiled his first television commercial this week,
the first truly irreverent candidate commercial of the 2000
election. A takeoff on the Mastercard ``priceless'' advertising
campaign, the 30-second commercial is running on cable and on local
broadcast stations in Los Angeles; San Francisco; Sacramento and
Santa Barbara, Calif.; New York; Portland, Ore.; Seattle, and
Washington.

   ON THE SCREEN:

   With ``Hail to the Chief'' playing, stock footage rolls of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore greeting and
speaking to supporters at various public functions, followed by a
video montage of Nader through the years.

   SCRIPT:

   Announcer: Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate.
Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million. Promises to
special interest groups: over $10 billion. Finding out the truth:
priceless. There are some things money can't buy. Without Ralph
Nader in the presidential debates, the truth will come in last.

for president.

   ACCURACY:
</P>
<P>
   With a cheeky spot like this, hyperbole is the name of the game,
although one could easily make the case that millions going to
``campaign ads filled with half-truths'' is not off the mark. The
reference to the cost of ``promises to special interest groups'' is
a reflection of a central tenet of Nader's campaign, that without
campaign finance reform, the major parties are beholden to those
with deep pockets and are thus indistinguishable from each other.
The spot's advocacy of Nader's inclusion in debates refers to a
decision by the commission on presidential debates that only
candidates with an average of 15 percent or more in five leading
national polls will be allowed to participate. The threshold is
virtually unattainable, say Nader and another third-party
contender, Pat Buchanan, without the national exposure of a
televised debate.

   SCORECARD:
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats will be happy about
this spot. In other words, viewers may find it a genuine relief
from the earnest biographical and issue advertisements on which the
parties and major candidates have been spending tens of millions of
dollars all summer. Nader's media consultant, Hillsman, was the
mastermind of Paul Wellstone's successful media strategy in his
1990 race in Minnesota for the U.S. Senate, an offbeat campaign for
an offbeat candidate that is now considered a classic. With an
album of shots of a younger, crusading Nader, the Green Party
candidate for president, this spot takes advantage of Nader's
reputation for saying what others in politics will not. And it
cleverly shades a scathing message in parody as it tries to connect
with voters' cynicism about the way campaigns are financed. The use
of the airwaves to make the case for Nader's continued presence on
the airwaves, in the televised debates, is yet another of the
spot's nifty nuances.
