NADER TALKS, LABOR LISTENS AND MANY DEMOCRATS WORRY 
</HEADLINE>

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ralph Nader was on a tear, railing against
chief executives' salaries, the corporate-dominated campaign
finance system and cuts in factory inspections. Several of the
steelworkers seated around him were nodding, and then nodding
again, in silent approval.
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes at least, it seemed as if the steelworkers'
cynicism about politics and politicians had evaporated, and they
were receiving the truth, or at least a truth they rarely hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the guys who work hard,'' said Nader, the Green Party
candidate for president. ``You're the guys who pay the taxes.
You're the guys who fight the wars, and then they say, `Tough.
We're closing the factory. It's globalization.' And then they use
factories overseas where dictators repress the wages to compete
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader _ whose words, though not his speaking style, are laced
with emotion _ then laid into Vice President Al Gore and other
Democratic politicians, saying they have done little for labor
because they have been able to take labor's support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're taken for granted, you're taken,'' he said. ``When
organized labor can say to these candidates, `You're not going to
take us for granted anymore, we have an alternative and the
alternative is Nader and the Green Party,' then they'll start
calling, then they'll start catering to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the 20 steelworkers who had squeezed into a small
Ohio State University classroom to hear Nader gave him rave
reviews, and many of them vowed to vote for him this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Nader is the best of anyone,'' said David Cole, an
electrician at AK Steel's mill in Mansfield, who drove 75 minutes
to hear Nader. ``I really like him. I haven't seen much from anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend and co-worker Larry Pugh was just as enthusiastic.
``I think he has the right answers,'' said Pugh, a crane operator
at the plant, where management locked out 620 workers last
September. ``He gives us a choice because the Democrats and
Republicans have sold us down the river.''
</P>
<P>
   This outpouring of enthusiasm for Nader worries many Democrats,
who fear that so many steelworkers, autoworkers, Teamsters and
other union members will vote for him this fall that it could cause
Gore to lose in Ohio and other large Midwestern swing states. For
the Democrats, an added concern is that two of the largest, most
powerful unions in the Midwest, the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, have flirted with Nader and have not endorsed Gore, even
though the AFL-CIO is backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Many steelworkers are still angry at Gore because he backed the
agreement to normalize trade relations with China, an accord that
many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of U.S.
factories to China. Although Nader is best known for his crusading
on consumer protection and the environment, he has grown closer to
labor unions in recent years, fighting alongside them against the
China trade deal, the World Trade Organization and the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the steelworkers at Columbus hailed Nader, several
said they would still vote for Gore, explaining that they feared
Gov. George W. Bush would win if Nader drained too many votes away
from the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank you for championing our issues,'' Skip Hall,
another steelworker who drove in from Mansfield, told Nader.
``You're terrifying the Democrats. You know this is going to be a
very close election. In 1980, I was dissatisfied with Jimmy Carter.
I backed Ted Kennedy, and we ended up with Ronald Reagan. He gave
us a bad Supreme Court. We're still living with that today. That's
the dilemma we face today. The same thing could happen with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement generated by Nader also concerns some labor
leaders. John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, has repeatedly
urged union members to back Gore, saying it is important to prevent
Bush from winning because working with a Republican Congress, he
might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
was one of labor's most vociferous critics of the China trade deal,
but he now says it is time to line up behind Gore. He said in an
interview that labor's support for Nader was modest and would grow
smaller, and he predicted that many union members leaning toward
Nader would ultimately vote for Gore upon realizing that Nader
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two viable candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush,
and we're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members
and the issues of working people,'' Becker said. ``Nader's a fine
man. He takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us. But
he is not a viable candidate. In that regard, anybody who would
support Ralph Nader we think would lessen Al Gore's chances of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said that
the race between Gore and Bush was close in his state, but that he
did not think Nader would hurt the vice president. Recent polls
show Nader getting 4 percent of the vote in Ohio, compared with
more than 10 percent in California, but Leland said those were
high-water marks that were bound to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know a vote for Ralph Nader is a wasted vote at
best and a vote for George Bush at worst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said he hoped Gore would become more outspoken on
workers' issues to excite union members about his candidacy.
Indeed, on Monday, Gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in
Cleveland with 75 steelworkers from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and
Illinois. The Nader campaign sees this as a move to keep union
members from drifting toward their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said a central purpose of his candidacy was to move the
Democratic Party left on labor and other issues. To make it easier
for unions to organize, Nader called for making it legal for a
union to boycott not just the company it is striking against but
other companies that do business with it. (Such boycotts were
banned by the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.) He also called for
requiring employers to pay triple damages when they illegally fire
workers for supporting a union.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that he should be included in any presidential
debates, Nader said he would seek to force Gore and Bush to address
work-related issues, like occupational safety, that have been
largely ignored during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore will tell you, `I'm for you. I'm going to fight for you.
I'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes,''' Nader
said. ``But what has he done in eight years? I don't care what
you're for. I want to know what you've done. Talk is cheap.''
