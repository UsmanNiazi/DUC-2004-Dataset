   ATHENS _ Bowing to pressure, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
International Olympic Committee president, agreed Sunday to appear
at a hearing before Congress and answer allegations of corruption
in Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, deliberated here for hours between Samaranch and
his 10-member IOC executive council, followed warnings by the House
Commerce Committee that it would subpoena Samaranch if he failed to
appear voluntarily at the hearing Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully prepared to cooperate,'' Samaranch said. ``But not
now. It will have to be after Dec. 12.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when the IOC is expected to hold a crucial meeting in
Lausanne, Switzerland, to revise its charter in the wake of the
bribery scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's decision is an about-face for the IOC and could pave
the way for others to testify about Olympic scandals.
