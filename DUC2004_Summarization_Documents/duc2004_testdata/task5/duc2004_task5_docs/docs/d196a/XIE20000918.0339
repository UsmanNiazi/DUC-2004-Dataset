SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Olympic officials,
dignitaries and friends attended a memorial service Monday for the
wife of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch's wife Maria Teresa Samaranch passed away Saturday in
Barcelona, Spain after a brave fighting with cancer. She was 67.

<P>
An overflow crowd of about 350 people packed St. Patrick's
Catholic Church in downtown Sydney for the special Mass in the
memory of Maria Teresa Samaranch, who passed away Saturday in
Barcelona, Spain, at the age of 67.
</P>
<P>
The solemn 30-minute service was held in the same church where
Samaranch attended Mass only a week before his wife's death. One
of the priests who co-celebrated the memorial wore vestments with
the Olympic rings.

Seated in the front row was Australian swimming icon Dawn
Fraser, whom Samaranch had invited as his personal guest and stand-
in "Olympic first lady" for Friday's opening ceremony.

Samaranch, attending his last Olympics as head of the IOC after
20 years in office, left Sydney the morning after the ceremony and
rushed home in a private jet to be at his wife's bedside. But she
died while Samaranch was still in the air, two hours before
landing in Barcelona.

<P>
"She was a wonderful woman," Samaranch told reporters in
Barcelona. "I not only loved her, I admired her."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said his wife had been ill for several months and he
last spoke with her on September 3 before traveling to Sydney. He
said he was notified of her death by telephone during the flight
to Barcelona.

<P>
Following Tuesday's service, IOC officials said Samaranch had
reiterated that he plans to return to Sydney, probably by the
weekend.

Monday's service drew a high-profile congregation of Australian
federal and state government officials, International Olympic
Committee members and other Olympic delegates from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Australian dignitaries included Governor General William Deane,
New South Wales Premier Bob Carr and Sydney Lord Mayor Frank
Sartor.

Among others attending were Sydney Olympics Minister Michael
Knight, Salt Lake City organizing chief Mitt Romney and Athens
2004 leader Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki.
