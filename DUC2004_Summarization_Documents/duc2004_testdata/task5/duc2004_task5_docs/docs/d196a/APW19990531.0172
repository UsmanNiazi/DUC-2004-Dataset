<HEADLINE> Samaranch Intends To Complete Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch on Monday dismissed the notion of early retirement and 
insisted he will complete the remaining two years of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch played down any rift with IOC vice president Dick  
Pound, who last month suggested Samaranch might leave after 
ushering in reforms at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard cited the overwhelming vote of  
confidence -- 86-2 -- he won in a secret ballot in March during a 
special session dealing with the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position depends on the IOC members,'' Samaranch said in an  
interview Monday with The Associated Press. ``The secret ballot we 
had in Lausanne was very clear. The IOC members think I am the 
right man at this moment to lead the changes we need in the IOC. 
With the confidence of the IOC members, I am ready to finish my 
mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been in office since 1980, was re-elected to  
his latest four-year term in 1997. His successor is to be chosen at 
the IOC session in Moscow in September 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch plans to call a special general assembly in December  
to approve changes in the structure and operations of the IOC. An 
IOC commission is holding its first meeting in Lausanne this week 
to study the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, the IOC's chief negotiator of television and sponsorship  
deals, is a possible successor as IOC president. He said Samaranch 
might set an example by stepping down if the retirement age is 
lowered from 80 to 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wrote to Pound expressing disappointment at his  
remarks, which were quoted in an Australian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't judge what he said or did not say,'' Samaranch said.  
``What I am judging with Dick Pound is our relations of 18-19 
years. He is always working very close to me. I am giving him the 
most important responsibilities. Dick Pound was one who always 
defended me. I consider Dick Pound one of the most important 
members of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, in an unusual public rebuke by a fellow executive board  
member, Kevan Gosper of Australia criticized Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public comments by Dick Pound were rather unfortunate to  
say the least,'' said Gosper, another presidential hopeful. ``His 
postulation that Samaranch might go early was unwelcome. 
Samaranch's intentions are quite clear: He intends to see out his 
mandate. He has repeated that to me and I fully support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound is not attending the IOC meetings in Lausanne this week  
because of commencement exercises at Montreal's McGill University, 
where he holds a senior position. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a telephone interview with the AP, Pound reiterated that  
Samaranch could decide to leave early -- no matter his public 
pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every term has its limits,'' Pound said. ``But it's a term,  
not a sentence. If (Samaranch) were to decide sometime before the 
end of the term that he has done what he wants to do, he is free to 
make any decision he wants.''
