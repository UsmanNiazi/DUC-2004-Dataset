<HEADLINE> Samaranch to Stand for IOC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Juan-Antonio Samaranch told
Swiss radio in Lausanne on Wednesday that he would stand again for
president of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Spaniard said the only condition was being
given a clean bill of health and he was awaiting the results of a
recent check-up.
</P>
<P>
An IOC spokesman said an official statement would be made at
next week's Executive Board meeting.
</P>
<P>
There are no other declared candidates for the post.
</P>
<P>
It had been assumed Samaranch would stand for a fourth term
after the IOC voted at Budapest in June, 1995, to raise the
retirement age to 80, three days after Samaranch had failed to
abolish the age-limit altogether.
</P>
<P>
The change meant Samaranch could extend his reign until 2001,
when he would be 81.
</P>
<P>
The previous age-limit had been 75 and under the old rule
Samaranch, whose mandate runs to September, would have become
ineligible.
