Atlanta, May 20 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch defended the commercialization of
the Olympics here Monday and said he was "very happy" with
preparations for the Atlanta Games.

<P>
"We are certain that AGOC (the games organising committee) will
provide a marvelous Olympics," Samaranch told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch was present here Saturday when Vice President Al Gore
officially inaugurated the Olympic stadium.
</P>
<P>
Ask to comment on the invasion of sponsors whose billboards
have flooded the Olympic city, Samaranch said it was "thanks to
commercialization that the Olympics are democratic."
</P>
<P>
He said that Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, "our oldest sponsor" had
been a "big help" to the Olympic movement.

But Samaranch also pointed out that true to Olympic tradition,
the Olympic sites would be "free from all advertisements even if
losing such publicity costs us millions and millions of dollars."
</P>

Samaranch said that he was also satisfied with security
arrangements for more than 10,000 athletes who will take part in
the centenary Games here, adding that he had received assurances
from Gore that "all steps had been taken to ensure that nothing
bad happens."
