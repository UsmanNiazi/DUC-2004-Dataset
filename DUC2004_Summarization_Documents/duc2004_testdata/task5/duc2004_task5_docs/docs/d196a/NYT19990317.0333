   Lausanne, Switzerland Twice on Wednesday the International
Olympic Committee exploded into applause to show support for Juan
Antonio Samaranch, whom they have come to call simply ``the
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Samaranch demanded an official vote of confidence
to record in black and white what was obvious to all in the massive
closed chamber of the Palais Beaulieu: Samaranch will preside over
the IOC as long as he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, 86 of the 90 voting members returned ballots
expressing support for the 78-year-old Spaniard, whose head has
been demanded by media and critics around the world for his failure
to prevent the worst scandal in the history of the Modern Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Only two members opposed him. There was one blank ballot and
another not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is happy,'' said executive board member Jacques Rogge of
Belgium. ``What gives him so much strength is that he won so
overwhelmingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Samaranch's support comes from patronage: He handpicked
about 80 percent of the members. Additionally, he is genuinely
respected for his contributions to the Games, which were on the
verge of bankruptcy when he assumed control in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   So complete was the support for Samaranch that even one of the
six members expelled Wednesday had nothing but praise. Asked by
reporters about his feelings toward Samaranch, Agustin Arroyo, the
former member from Ecuador, launched into a lengthy review of
Samaranch's accomplishments after 18 years as the IOC's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget what Samaranch has done for the last 18 years,''
Arroyo said. ``He has spread the Olympic movement out to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are signs that Samaranch may not serve out his term,
which expires in 2001. Most of his strong public support from key
IOC members such as vice president Dick Pound have centered on the
notion that only Samaranch could lead the IOC through the tempest
caused by the Salt Lake City bidding crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, with the expulsion of the six members and the
firming up of plans to study and enact reforms by the end of the
year, it seemed that a course had been charted that would allow for
Samaranch's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's own address to the IOC seemed to presage a goodbye.
``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic
movement over the last 18 years,'' he said. ``My last service to
Olympism would be to restructure our organization in order to enter
the new millennium even stronger than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has told close friends lately that he fears a plot
within the IOC administration to force him from office. For the
most part, top officials shrug in amazement that he would get such
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a persistent rumor that Samaranch may retire
before the end of the year. A special session has been called for
December, when the IOC is expected to address the reform issues
head on.
</P>
<P>
   There are equally persistent rumors that he will wait until the
close of the Sydney Games, which are generally regarded as having
the potential of being so well done that no one will remember much
about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The big question surrounds a successor, however. Three members
of the executive board --Rogge, Dick Pound of Canada and Pal
Schmitt of Hungary -- are often mentioned as successors. Kim
Un-Yong of South Korea was considered a contender until he was
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal and received a harsh warning.
Another name that often is mentioned is Jean-Claude Killy, the
former Olympic skier who became an IOC member in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was coy about his plans in a brief interview with
reporters Wednesday morning before the vote. ``My idea is to remain
until 2001,'' Samaranch told reporters. ``But we will see.''
