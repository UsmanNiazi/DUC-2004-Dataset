<HEADLINE> Samaranch Faces Close Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- On the eve of the Nagano Winter Olympics, Juan  
Antonio Samaranch bragged about the success and health of the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something isn't broken, don't fix it,'' he said. ``The  
Olympic movement is in very good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Samaranch is besieged with calls for his  
resignation. Many blame him for the worst corruption scandal in 
Olympic history, which has prompted the expulsion or forced 
resignation of nine International Olympic Committee members 
implicated in misconduct in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard was appointed IOC president in 1980 and  
is the third longest-serving behind American Avery Brundage, who 
served from 1952-72, and Pierre de Coubertin, the French baron who 
founded the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	When Samaranch took over in 1980, the Olympic movement had been  
hit by terrorism, was facing bankruptcy and was brought to its 
knees by the catastrophic boycott of the 1980 Summer Games in 
Moscow by the United States, Canada and 52 other nations and 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
	A former diplomat, he used quiet diplomacy and his skills as a  
businessman to turn the Olympics into the most prestigious sporting 
event in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is credited with building the games into a  
multibillion-dollar industry, largely based on lucrative TV rights 
deals and the fierce competition among cities to land them. 
</P>
<P>
	With success has also come criticism about the rampant  
commercialism of the games. Samaranch has been characterized as a 
despot ruling over an inherently undemocratic, self-appointed body 
that lacks the normal financial controls of a multinational 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the IOC is incapable of policing itself, suggesting  
that Samaranch's greatest legacy to the Olympics would be his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation,'' he has said,  
adding there wasn't ``a single'' call within the IOC for him to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to his authoritarian image, Samaranch describes himself  
as ``the conductor'' who delegates to the 11-member IOC executive 
board. ``I'm not the boss,'' he likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is a small, shy man, visibly uncomfortable in the  
public spotlight. He's the IOC's first full-time executive and the 
first to live full time in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC's 
headquarters. He receives no salary, although he has said the next 
IOC president should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC pays the rent on a small hotel suite in Lausanne, which  
costs $220 a day when he's there and $72 when he's away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' Samaranch said. ``I am a normal man. My  
style of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I 
have no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board member Richard Pound described his lifestyle  
as ``practically monastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former boxer and roller hockey goalie who never competed for  
an Olympic medal, Samaranch grew up in Barcelona, Spain, as the son 
of a wealthy textile magnate. He still holds the honorary title of 
president of the Barcelona-based La Caixa, Spain's largest savings 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed an IOC member in 1966 and came to the  
presidency after three years as Spain's ambassador to the 
then-Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of his tenure came in 1992 when Barcelona played  
host to what's considered the most successful Summer Games of all 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	A low moment came earlier in the same year with the publication  
of the book ``The Lords of the Rings,'' which charged the Olympic 
movement with being corrupt, undemocratic and consumed by 
commercialism and greed. 
</P>
<P>
	The book recounted Samaranch's rise through Spain's political  
ranks during the 36-year rule of dictator Francisco Franco, and 
describes him as a ``dedicated Francoist'' who supported Franco's 
conglomeration of right-wing parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch called the book full of ``lies'' and ``mistakes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Spain know very well that I was collaborating  
with the Franco regime, like many others,'' he added. ``We are very 
proud of what we did. We went from the Franco regime to a full 
democracy in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, said the book gave him a reason to run for another  
term. He was re-elected in 1993, and in 1995 IOC members raised the 
retirement age, which cleared the way for him to run again. He was 
re-elected in 1997 and has vowed to stay until his term ends in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	He has appointed 94 IOC members. The body had 115 members,  
including Samaranch, before the nine resigned or were expelled. Of 
the 14 implicated in the scandal, Samaranch appointed eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch will put his leadership to a vote of confidence at a  
special IOC session March 17-18. Only if he fails to get the 
members' endorsement will he resign, Samaranch said. The chances of 
that are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain the Olympic movement will emerge from the crisis  
stronger than ever,'' Samaranch said.
