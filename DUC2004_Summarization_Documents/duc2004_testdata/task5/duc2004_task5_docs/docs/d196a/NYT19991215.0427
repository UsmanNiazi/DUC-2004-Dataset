   WASHINGTON _ Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee, had not begun to testify before
Congress on Wednesday when he was asked to resign, setting the tone
for his appearance before a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like you to announce today that you'll resign,'' said Rep.
Joe Barton, R-Texas. ``This is a great venue to be a true statesman
of sport and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else sought Samaranch's resignation, but he was
questioned relentlessly for more than two hours on the major
changes enacted last weekend by the IOC, as well as on the
organization's failure to investigate its members for past abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive handling of Samaranch, 79, by the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demonstrated the
fervor with which Congress has attached itself to Olympic reform.
Before Wednesday, a Senate committee had already held two hearings
and the House subcommittee one without Samaranch, who refused to
appear until the changes had been approved by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the reforms have been adopted, some people think
Congress should step aside,'' Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said.
``I disagree. Congress should make sure the reforms are
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   If the changes enacted last weekend in Lausanne, Switzerland,
are ineffective, Waxman said, sanctions should be imposed on the
IOC, including stripping the committee of its tax-exempt status in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his time before the subcommittee, Samaranch was chastised for
answers that were too long and reminded that he was testifying
under oath. He was mocked for lacking the zeal to attack corruption
until last year's revelation of a scandal involving illicit cash
and gifts provided to IOC members by Salt Lake City's organizing
committee for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., tried to determine
the investigative muscle of a new ethics commission created by the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the commission compel members to testify about
wrongdoing?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics commission is totally independent,'' Samaranch
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``So you don't know, as president of the IOC, if the
ethics commission can compel testimony?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``You do know?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``And will they be able to compel testimony?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``They are fully independent and will act as they
find wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``Is that a yes or a no?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``As I say, the ethics commission is independent.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``If you don't know, I'll ask someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``I do know, and the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ethics commission has not yet adopted a set of
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the ethics commission is a work in progress,''
DeGette said, ``the IOC cannot be considered reformed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Samaranch enjoyed few peaceful moments, he never appeared
ruffled. Speaking through an interpreter, Samaranch, who is
Spanish, praised the ``fundamental package of reform'' that he said
created a ``renovated IOC,'' with flexible term limits, open
meetings and a ban on trips by members to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his right to remain exempt from rules against gifts
to IOC members, because he said he did not influence the selection
of host cities. ``I didn't think it was necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, what if this committee thought it was necessary?'' Barton
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be glad to listen,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch labeled as a lie a report that his suite at the Palace
Hotel in Lausanne costs the IOC $500,000 a year. He said his suite
is far from luxurious, costing $250 a day when he is in town to
work at IOC headquarters and $70 a day to hold his reservation when
he is traveling.
</P>
<P>
   And he said there was nothing wrong with a $12,000 trip to
Atlanta that his wife took with a friend in 1990; the trip was paid
for by the city's 1996 Olympic organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when questioned about whether the Atlanta committee should
have paid for a trip that lacked a discernible Olympic business
goal, Samaranch said: ``You are probably right. This is a problem
with the organizing committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman spent little time on the Olympic scandals that made
headlines late last year and earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he criticized Samaranch for failing to allow bidding
for the television rights to the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney and
the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. NBC paid $1.2 billion for
the rights, and then donated $1 million to the Olympic Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, there were no requests for bids,'' Samaranch said. ``We
felt NBC deserved our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports and a member of the IOC
reform commission, said after leaving the hearing that the
network's bid for both Olympic games had been pre-emptive. He also
said that the donation had not been solicited by Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to acknowledge our happiness with being such an
important part of the Olympic movement,'' Ebersol said.
