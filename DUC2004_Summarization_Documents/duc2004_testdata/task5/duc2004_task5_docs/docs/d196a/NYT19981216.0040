   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INTERNATIONAL Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch is
in his bliss when the horns are trumpeting, the flags are waving
and the world is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, a man who once described himself as more important
than the Pope, is Lord of the rings _ with a capital ``L,'' at
least in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He loves the grandeur of an international moment and being at
the center of it. He revels in Olympic splendor and being the one
who represents it.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Samaranch loves when the winners are
marching in, the Olympic theme is playing and costumed youths are
standing before him holding pillows on which are lying the revered
gold, silver and bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the glory is tainted. Samaranch is not presenting
medals but wearing one. It's the one he most often slips on when
times become sticky: Teflon.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest scandal Samaranch's Games have seen since Ben
Johnson is upon him. This time, he should not slink away behind the
hallowed walls of the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to
hide behind the pristine image he has so carefully _ and we must
say, artfully _ crafted.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Samaranch should stand before the world and do what
is not only right but deserved. He should take responsibility for
the shadiness that has secretly plagued Olympic bids for years and
last week was firmly connected to the Salt Lake City 2002
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   The world is watching. Potential bid cities such as ours are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for the Houston 2012 committee to understand the
hurdles and lobbying efforts it will face if it eventually earns
the right to solicit IOC votes. It is quite another for the 2012
committee to see the Salt Lake developments, watch Samaranch try to
let it slide away, and then tell government leaders that Houston
still wants to make an Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch should expand the investigation into the
bribes-for-votes scandal that is chipping away at the Games' image
bit by bit. He should do it for the sake of the Games. He should do
it for those cities like ours, which would be crazy to stay in a
race that is looking tainted and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samaranch is sweeping it away like an aberration. In
all likelihood, the Salt Lake scandal was not an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Other successful Olympic bids under Samaranch's watch reportedly
hinged on similar scams and illicit gifts, including scholarships
for IOC voters' family members, which is at the heart of the Salt
Lake scandal. Other bribes reportedly included luxurious vacations
and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch always called those charges outrageous, which they
might well have been. But the IOC should find out. Houston 2012
should know if this is true before it goes any further. And if the
years of rumor and innuendo prove to be true, Samaranch should
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samaranch pulled on the Teflon in the wake of the
scandal and vowed to take care of the problem but not look further
than Salt Lake unless hard evidence comes forward.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it already has. Marc Hodler, a longtime IOC member and
by most accounts a reputable man, said he has information that
points to similar gifts-for-votes scams since before 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations are agents securing IOC votes in exchange
for up to $3 million once the bid is won. When this information
came out Sunday, Samaranch didn't change his stance regarding
further investigations. He did, however, muzzle Hodler and announce
that only he or IOC director general Francois Carrad would publicly
comment on the Salt Lake issue.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Samaranch sidestepped something that should be
attacked head-on. Only last summer, Samaranch enraged anti-doping
advocates when he all but gave performance-enhancing drugs his
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doping damages the health of the sportsman and, second,
artificially increases his performance,'' Samaranch told a Madrid
publication. ``If it produces only this second condition, for me
that's not doping.''
</P>
<P>
   For Samaranch, no harm, no foul.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who helped build the Games into something
magnificent and profitable but then wrapped himself so much in his
own glory that he became numb to all things real.
</P>
<P>
   An example: In Nagano during the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch
demanded many luxuries from organizers, including having a Catholic
priest come to his room every Sunday to offer a private service.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was informed that his hotel was less than a mile from
one of the few Catholic churches in the Buddhist nation. He was
told the priest often must travel to surrounding cities for other
services after an early-morning Mass in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, Samaranch said. Eventually, priests were flown 500
miles from Tokyo to offer Samaranch a private service.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch shouldn't hide behind the Teflon medal this time. The
investigation needs to go further, not just for the sake of the
Games but for those cities hoping to carry the pristine image into
the next century. And the first place Samaranch should look is in
the mirror.
