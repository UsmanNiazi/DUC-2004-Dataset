IOC president to push for change in Olympic soccer format

	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The head of the International Olympic
Committee said Friday he will urge the next FIFA president to drop
the under-23 format for Olympic soccer and open up the competition
to all the world's best players.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he will discuss
scrapping the restrictions with the winner of next Monday's FIFA
presidential election in Paris.
	   Lennart Johansson, head of the European federation UEFA, and
FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter are the two candidates to
succeed outgoing president Joao Havelange.
	   ``This is something we have in our agenda _ to discuss with the
new president the possibility to increase the number of players
without the age limit,'' Samaranch said.
	   FIFA, eager to guard the supremacy of its World Cup, has
restricted the Olympic soccer competition to players under the age
of 23 _ resulting in what amounts to an amateur or youth
tournament.
	   The rule was relaxed for the 1996 Atlanta Games and the 2000
Sydney Games to allow teams to field three players over 23.
	   ``Maybe this figure can be increased,'' Samaranch said. ``Our
dream is to have an open football tournament, but we think we need
some years to (achieve) this aim.''
	   Samaranch said the IOC enjoyed close relations with FIFA and
Havelange, a Brazilian who has been an IOC member since 1963.
	   ``We are sure the next president will follow the same way and
that relations with the IOC will be very friendly,'' he said.
	   On a related matter, Samaranch said he plans to appoint the next
FIFA president as an IOC member.
	   ``FIFA is maybe the most important federation in the world,'' he
said. ``To have the president of FIFA inside the IOC is something
we would like to have.''
	   Samaranch spoke at a news conference at the close of a joint
meeting of the IOC executive board and the Association of National
Olympic Committees, which represents the world's 198 national
governing bodies.
	   Samaranch repeated his message, delivered earlier this week to
the U.S. Olympic Committee, that American athletes must improve
their medal performance to ensure the success of the 2002 Winter
Games in Salt Lake City.
	   The United States won 13 medals, including six gold, at the
Nagano Games in February. The total matched the best ever U.S.
performance at a winter games but was still below expectations.
	   ``All the home teams must get good results, because if not, the
people they are very much disappointed,'' Samaranch said. ``We
reminded the USOC ... they must have an effort to improve their
results. The results were good results but maybe they must be
excellent, not only good.''
	   Samaranch also virtually ruled out the possibility of adding
women's ski jumping for the Salt Lake Games, saying the event has
not yet been established on a world-class level.
	   ``The Olympic Games can not be an experiment,'' he said. ``The
event must be tested in world championships. Many countries must
have participation. I think it's too early for this event.''
	   On an issue affecting the 2000 Sydney Games, Samaranch said the
IOC was powerless to stop price gouging by hotels which are not
contracted by the local organizing committee.
	   A delegate at this week's meetings complained that three-star
hotels in Sydney could charge up to dlrs 550 a night for a room.
	   ``That is the market,'' Samaranch said. ``The market is free. We
can do nothing. We can only ask to respect the prices for the
Olympic family. I'm sure these prices will be respected.''
	   On doping, Samaranch said the IOC could not force international
federations to carry out year-round drug testing programs, and he
ruled out calls for sports to be thrown out of the Olympics unless
they comply.
	   ``We are doing our best to convince them,'' Samaranch said.
``The most important federations are doing their best. We will
follow this way. To say you must do this or you are not in the
Olympics, that is not the way to do things. We prefer to convince,
not to impose.''
	   Samaranch sided with the national Olympic committees in their
dispute with international federations over who has control over
athletes' uniforms during the games. The federations have pushing
to change the Olympic Charter to give them more control.
	   ``It's very simple,'' Samaranch said. ``We have an Olympic
Charter. We have rules and we will abide by these rules.''
