   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Philip Glass is not your usual Hollywood hired
hand. Sometimes erroneously referred to as a minimalist composer,
the prolific Glass is anything but, which is why he is such an
interesting choice to write an original score for a classic film
that never had one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Universal released Todd Browning's 1931 ``Dracula''
on video ($14.98) with a newly written score by Glass. It's
performed by the acclaimed string ensemble the Kronos Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who has written everything from operas to symphonic works
to ballets, has too often been given short shrift by classical
critics who dislike his repetitive style, overlooking his use of
rhythm and dynamics to create music that is just as moving as any
from long-dead classical icons. Luckily, as his body of work has
grown, so has Glass' prestige. The recent premiere of his
``Symphony No. 5 (Choral): Requiem, Bardo and Nirmanakaya'' in
Salzburg, Austria, met with strong praise.
</P>
<P>
   With never a shortage of other projects to work on, Glass'
choice of films to score is as interesting and eclectic as the
composer's music. He has worked with such high-powered directors as
Martin Scorsese (``Kundun''), Paul Schrader (``Mishima''), Errol
Morris (``Thin Blue Line'') and Godfrey Reggio on
``Koyaanisqatsi,'' a dazzling cinematic feast that relies totally
on Glass' score. In addition, you probably heard Glass' music in
``The Truman Show'' last year. Not a bad group of films to spend a
couple of evenings viewing on video.
</P>
<P>
   As for why he decided to score a 68-year-old horror film, Glass
explains by saying that ``many films have been made on Dracula
since ... however, none are equal in eloquence or the sheer power
to move us.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass was being a bit kind. ``Dracula'' was served well by
director Browning's strange sensibilities and Bela Lugosi's
alternately mesmerizing and hammy performance. But Browning was no
great shakes as a director. His other notable film was the 1932
``Freaks,'' which used actual circus freaks and was withdrawn from
distribution for a while because of public revulsion. What Browning
lacked in directorial skills, however, he made up for with his eye
for the odd, especially in ``Freaks,'' although he is clearly
sympathetic to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Browning, like most directors at the time, had not
yet come to grips with the sound era. ``Dracula,'' which was based
on a stage play, moodily creaks along, punctuated by creepy shots _
whether a close-up of the distorted face of Lugosi or a slithering
snake _ that makes your skin crawl a bit. Later on, Browning did a
much better undead story, also with Lugosi, the 1935 ``Mark of the
Vampire,'' but by then his career was on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' evocative new soundtrack points up both the strengths and
weaknesses of the film. (The original film did not have a score,
though bits of Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake'' were used sparingly _ in
case you swear there was music). At times, Glass' sweeping music
clashes with the slow-moving action, making it more apparent how
hamstrung Browning was by the awkward way sound was recorded at the
time; other times Glass' music will enliven a scene, such as the
trip up to Castle Dracula. At its best, Glass' music, while
maintaining his distinctive sound, meshes with the macabre nature
of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tampering with a supposed ``classic'' will rankle
some film buffs the way colorization did, but there are
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with colorization is that black-and-white films are
lit differently during filming, and the colorization only served to
illustrate that, usually in an annoying fashion. But ``Dracula''
came out in that in-between era when sound systems were still being
installed in many theaters, and it was actually shown as a silent
film in some places. The film's lack of a score was due more to
primitive technology than choice. And now there is more than
cinematic curiosity and camp for reasons to watch ``Dracula'': a
provocative soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   For Halloween, Glass and the Kronos Quartet, which recently
replaced its cellist, will perform the score for ``Dracula'' during
screenings of the film on Oct. 30 and 31 at UCLA's Royce Hall. Film
purists may call it a trick, but it's really a treat. &UR;  &QL;
