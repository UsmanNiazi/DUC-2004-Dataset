   NEW YORK _ When ``Koyaanisqatsi'' had its first showings in 1983
the term post-Minimalism had not yet been coined. But this
ecological meditation by the filmmaker Godfrey Reggio and the
composer Philip Glass proclaimed the limitations of Minimalism as a
description for a movement in the arts that stripped away certain
traditional elements of structure and focused on others.
</P>
<P>
   There was, after all, a degree to which contributions by Reggio
and Glass' to the project fit that original definition: the film
has neither dialogue nor voice-overs, just Reggio's images and a
score rich in the repetitive figuration that had become emblematic
of Minimalist music.
</P>
<P>
   But Reggio's vistas are varied and complex. Hopi rock paintings
are contrasted with nuclear blasts and rocket launches; the
unharnessed forces of wind and water with the mechanistic densities
of modern urban life. Within these images, though, contradictions
abound. Unblemished nature is shown to be beautiful, yet the rock
formations and vast desertscapes also register as harsh and
lethally inhospitable.
</P>
<P>
   Modernity is mostly shown unflatteringly through glimpses of
rusted metal, ruined buildings and machinery spewing pollution; yet
Reggio's aerial film of highways, sped up so that the traffic melts
into shimmering streams of red and white light, is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   These pictures are framed and manipulated in a painterly way and
they convey far more information _ and provocation to thought _
than dialogue could have done. Glass' score, despite its
repetitions and motoric rhythms, abandons the abstraction of early
Minimalism in favor of an undeniable emotional current that
reinforces and interacts with the visual imagery. It is not just
that the music colors our perception of the images; it works the
other way around as well.
</P>
<P>
   For a revival of the film at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on
Saturday, the soundtrack was replaced by a live performance of the
score by the Philip Glass Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Stretches of the score use soft timbres, slow tempos and
minor-key chord progressions that sound melancholy on their own,
but suggest other things _ from grandeur to horrid fascination _
depending what Reggio has on the screen. The more frenetic, brashly
aggressive sections of the score are perfect accompaniments for
Reggio's high-speed images of traffic patterns and electronic
arcade games.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to prefer the film in its pure form, with its
original soundtrack, not least because the recorded sound _ a
combination of electronic and orchestral instruments and the
Western Wind vocal ensemble _ has a flexibility and breadth of
timbres that cannot be equaled by Glass' ensemble of keyboards,
winds and voices.
</P>
<P>
   What the live performance had, though, is a visceral impact that
the film score, even when played loud, does not equal. Perhaps
because of differences in instrumentation, there were some
appealing harmonic touches in the live version that are less
apparent in the original.
</P>
<P>
   Glass was among the keyboardists in his group, but as always, he
left the conducting to Michael Riesman, who kept the rhythms of the
score and the film closely matched.
