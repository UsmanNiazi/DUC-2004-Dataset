   The merging of music and technology has become a cornerstone of
Philip Glass's career. But 15 years ago, the two reached an
unhappy, and oddly ironic, impasse. The avant-garde composer had
written the score for Godfrey Reggio's 1983 film ``Koyaanisqatsi,''
a wordless meditation on technology's domination of Western
society. In preparation for the film's release, Glass was forced to
cut 30 minutes of the score so that it would fit on an LP, which
could hold only 25 minutes on each side. The album was released on
Nonesuch Records less than a year before compact discs usurped
vinyl as the popular medium. ``It was a big problem,'' Glass
recalls during a phone conversation from his home in New York City.
``The original album only had 42 minutes. But we thought it was
important to release it, and of course we didn't realize that CDs
were a year away.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass has at last rectified that problem with a new recording
for ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' produced by Kurt Munkacsi. Apart from some
sound effects and transitional cues, which were left out ``for the
sake of brevity'' according to Glass, the complete soundtrack has
been resurrected. In celebration of the new release, Philip Glass
and the Philip Glass Ensemble will perform live accompaniment to
screenings of ``Koyaanisqatsi'' in London, Belfast, New York, Los
Angeles, and Boston.

   It's a misconception that Glass dedicated seven years to
composing the score. ``No, no. I spent a lot of time thinking about
the music, but not actually writing it,'' Glass explains. ``We kept
running out of money.'' It was Reggio who _ long before independent
films became the bountiful lifeline of cinematic artistry they are
today _ spent seven years rounding up funds to chronicle the
dueling forces of the natural and man-made worlds. For Glass,
however, those uncertain years were anything but fruitless. ``I
knew what that film was about, and how to work with the images _
the images and the music became very organic. We had a lot of time
to experiment. When it came time to write, I knew exactly what I
wanted to write.''

   ``Koyaanisqatsi'' is a Hopi word that translates to ``life out
of balance.'' Interspersing magnificent panoramas of natural
splendor with barrages of dense, accelerating cityscapes, the film
surges with a visual pulse that flows _ flashing and simmering with
remarkable texture and motion _ through the American landscape. The
whole swarm of life is rendered with apocalyptic grace, using
slow-motion and time-lapse film techniques. But with no dialogue or
narrative structure, the film had to find its emotional undertow,
its ebb and flow of energy and ideas, in music. Glass's minimalist
vocabulary captures, with striking synergy, the majesty of
billowing clouds, the relentless buzz and hum of urban motion, and
the righteous chant of the filmmaker's vision.

   ``There was no story in the normal sense, but there is a whole
dramaturgical structure, a whole argument, made through the music
and images,'' says Glass. ``I had pages of text that Godfrey had
written, theories of civilization and technology. He had a very
complete idea, a whole point of view. It just never took the form
of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   For a composer who insists he has no theories about music, who
describes himself as a theater music composer who relies on
collaborative interaction for inspiration and subject matter for
direction, such a project presented a unique challenge. ``It's
amazing how specific the requirements for the music were,'' Glass
says, ``because there were no words. What is the right emotion for
a picture? Sometimes it goes against expectation; for instance, the
images that start with planes and end with bombs have lyrical,
beautiful music. The relationship is very complicated; it can be
near or far. And if you overstate it, it becomes cliched.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his wont, Glass allowed the collaborative spark, which
he's found with artists as diverse as Doris Lessing, Ravi Shankar,
Allen Ginsberg, and David Byrne, to guide him. ``That source of
inspiration is the most interesting, the most democratic,
quality,'' Glass states emphatically. ``Godfrey and I worked with
assemblages of images. I'd write music, then we'd cut images, then
write more music, then cut images. That we had the time _ that was
a blessing in disguise. This really was the classic independent
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, Glass believes the film and the music,
which encapsulates the repetitive motifs and spare tonality that
have become his trademark, stand the test of time. ``It sounds very
good, very strong. I thought it might sound dated, but I was
impressed,'' Glass says, with characteristically unabashed
self-regard. ``The subject matter isn't dated, just the ties people
wear. I found Godfrey's premise a little too New Agey at the time,
but our views have become closer. He never talks about technology
as negative, but rather inescapable. It's even more true now. The
natural, organic world is not the world we live in, especially in
New York or Boston where you and I live.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical world Glass inhabits is, as usual, full to bursting.
Among his current projects are an international tour for ``Monsters
of Grace,'' a digitally animated opera with longtime collaborator
Robert Wilson; finishing a symphony for orchestra, choir,
children's choir, and five soloists to premiere Aug. 28 at the
Salzburg Festival in Austria; completing a short opera based on
``The Penal Colony'' by Franz Kafka; and finishing a piano concerto
for Dennis Russell Davies to commemorate the millennium. At 61,
Glass looks to the future with the same enthusiasm for creative
interaction that has defined a remarkable 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky,'' Glass reflects. ``I've worked hard, but
I've had a lot of help. Whether it's Twyla (Tharp) or Bob Wilson or
Michael Stipe _ talent shows up anywhere. You'll meet someone and
find it. It has nothing to do with what you expect. So I just
wander around.''
