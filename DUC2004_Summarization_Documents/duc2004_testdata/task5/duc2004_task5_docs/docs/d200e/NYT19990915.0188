 &HT;    Kronos, Glass in black, white

   Those brand-name vanguardists, foxy chamber group Kronos Quartet
and minimalist/pop composer Philip Glass, tag-team the silent
cinema on their latest collaboration: a score for Todd Browning's
1931 horror classic, ``Dracula.'' Packaged with the menacing visage
of Bela Lugosi glaring from the CD's cardboard slipcover, the
project immediately piques your curiosity.

   Glass, who is frequently linked to such fellow '60s-identified,
repetition-minded, rock 'n' roll-friendly composers Steve Reich and
Terry Riley, has a virtual second career as a soundtrack guy. His
credits include unconventional documentaries like ``The Thin Blue
Line'' and ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' epics like Martin Scorsese's
``Kundun'' and even the B-movie slasher ``Candyman'' (which he
disowns, sort of). Half the time, his work sounds cheesy and
blithely recycled; but when it's inspired, a Glass score flaunts a
multifaceted opulence, its hypnotic insistence pulling you through
the surface into a hall of mirrors.

   ``Dracula'' is good Glass. His keyboard-based music translates
with appealing simplicity to string quartet, especially one as
well-recorded as the Kronos, which plays these 26 short pieces
(from 43 seconds to nearly five minutes) with a crisp elegance.
Maybe it's the brevity of the segments or the desire to complement
those shadowy black-and-white images, but the composer's signature
repetitions never get, you know, repetitious. Neither does it
succumb to heavy-handed drama, stroking romantic touchstones
without evoking the same old gloom and doom from the tomb.
