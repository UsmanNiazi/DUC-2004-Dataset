	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ America's best known living composer
Philip Glass won local acclaim for his new opera ``The White
Raven'', which had its world premiere this weekend at the Lisbon
world's fair.
	   ``A tranquil piece with magnificent moments,'' was how the Daily
Diario de Noticias on Sunday described the work performed the
previous evening.
	   The opera, directed and designed by Glass' usual partner Robert
Wilson, was staged to mark the final days of the Expo '98 world
fair, due to close Sept. 30.
	   ``It's a historic piece. It's serious and very moving
sometimes,'' Glass said.
	   The opera is expected to be staged in Madrid, Spain, in
November.
