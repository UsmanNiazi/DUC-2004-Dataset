   PHOENIX - Twentieth-century music wanes, dying away in echoes.
Listen to the music of Philip Glass, and the echoes are of intense
harmonic consonance; of overlapping, trance-inducing beat patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the echoes do not match their sources. The
originating sounds, the musics of the early 20th century, were
abstracted and dissonant, jagged and brittle. Yet the echoes are an
eternal vamp of simple chords oodling away over a steady beat.
</P>
<P>
   The musical 20th century, which began with all 12 tones sounding
at once, is ending with a major triad in hypnotic repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it: What the hell happened? How
could such a beginning have such an ending? It's as if a tale that
started with the promise of dense plot structure and complex
characters concluded in the elimination of character and the
abandonment of plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explain it this way,'' says Glass over the phone from New
York. ``At the beginning of the 20th century, we had a crisis in
tonality. At the end of the 20th century, we have another crisis in
tonality. In between, we learned a terrific amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass bears a large portion of responsibility for the way the
musical century is ending. It was he who codified the language of
Minimalism when it emerged from the 1960s out of rock and roll and
Indian ragas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minimalism'' may be an old-hat term, and one Glass has not
used for many years, but its core meaning still applies to what
might more accurately be called The New Sound of Postmodern
composers: simple harmonic materials and pulse-oriented rhythms in
structures that emphasize repetition, frequently with melodic
material borrowed from cultures other than the West (Glass has
borrowed from India, North Africa and other cultures) or from
contemporary pop music (two Glass works are based on material by
David Bowie).
</P>
<P>
   It was also Glass who found in the theater the best and true
home for The New Sound, putting his ideas to work in such stage
pieces as ``Einstein on the Beach'' and ``Satyagraha.'' Glass'
theater affiliation is perfect for his music, because it throws
interest from the aural to the visual, turning the music into
illustration. Nowhere is the visual element's primacy in a Glass
opera more obvious than in the publicity surrounding his newest,
``Monsters of Grace'':
</P>
<P>
   High Art Meets High Tech! A digital opera in three dimensions.
3D GLASSES PROVIDED!
</P>
<P>
   From that you can ascertain that the opera, staged by
avant-garde director and longtime Glass collaborator Robert Wilson,
will use 3-D technologies, computer-generated images and
stereoscopic film in addition to live action.
</P>
<P>
   That's what to expect theatrically. What can we expect
musically? It should depend upon the ears that hear it. I find few
stylistic differences in his scores from one to the next. But
Glassophiles seem to find in each new foray by their hero some tiny
bit of change that augurs new artistic horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The composer, speaking for himself, sees the seminal
accomplishment of his career very clearly as the positioning of
rhythm at the center of musical structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the progression in harmony from Monteverdi to
Schonberg, is a gradual expansion and addition of the harmonic
language. There's the famous passage in Wagner where you can no
longer tell what key you're in, and then Schonberg comes along and
resolves the matter in 12-tone,'' Glass says.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first ``crisis in tonality.'' Harmony as the basis
of musical structure had become so complicated that it had to break
up and be pieced back together in the early 20th century as Arnold
Scho nberg's dodecaphony.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg's 12-tone music _ the deliberately dissonant language
sometimes called serialism _ may have failed as a popular language,
says Glass, but it retrained our ears:
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole development of serial techniques taught us to listen
in a very different way. If you go to any movie, the language of
ordinary commercial music is radically different from 100 years
ago. The whole parameters of consonance and dissonance have
shifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift eventually brought about Glass' ``second crisis in
tonality,'' the absence of structure. Structure had always been
harmony-based, and with traditional functional harmonies gone,
where was structure's rationale? Glass's answer was to substitute
rhythm:
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was, `Which one is the functional element
(harmony or rhythm)? Which one drives the structure of a piece?' In
my early works I employed rhythmic structure first, then later
reintegrated the ideas of harmonic or tonal structure. I was
looking at the possibility that rhythmic structure could form an
overall structure, with harmony and rhythm in a unified field.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass' ``unified field theory'' was first employed in,
appropriately enough, ``Einstein on the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if the old man couldn't do it, maybe I could,''
Glass laughs, referring to Einstein's failed effort to forge the
original unified field theory of physics.
</P>
<P>
   But Glass' unified field theory may be no more successful than
Einstein's. Rhythm _ more specifically, the beat or pulse _ remains
primary even in Glass' more recent and harmonically somewhat less
redundant music. It could be that the matter of harmony vs. rhythm
as structural primaries remain either-or. In Glass and in all the
New Sound music, harmony takes a back seat to an even pulse.
</P>
<P>
   If Schonberg is the Alpha and Glass the Omega of 20th-century
Western art music, the alphabet between is more diverse than you'd
expect. Glass loves it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the 20th century, I think of John Cage and
John Coltrane, Rachmaninoff and Messiaen. I think of Bob Dylan. The
range of creative music in the 20th century is breathtaking, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   We started by asking how a single century could begin with
absolute dissonance and conclude in its opposite. Here's my best
guess, take it or leave it:
</P>
<P>
   Theory. The 20th century has been defined by theory. Not all of
it _ not even most of it _ but the parts that prop it up as an
object for music historians. Schonberg theorized that music could
be made with 12 tones of equal importance, without a tonal center.
The theory came first, the practice later. Glass theorized that
music could be made of rhythm with harmonies attached almost as
afterthoughts, and then he practiced what he theorized.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not these gambits were generated by ``crises in
tonality'' is beside the point. And whether in practice they have
succeeded in producing great music matters not so much to a
theory-obsessed century as their success in redefining what music
can be. &QL;
