   FORT WORTH _ The Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall
isn't just for the traditional fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fort Worth Symphony, the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet,
the Fort Worth Opera and the Van Cliburn Foundation will present
traditional seasons at Bass performance hall starting in September,
Performing Arts Fort Worth _ the private, nonprofit organization
that built, owns and operates the $65 million downtown multipurpose
facility _ will present its own 1998-99 season of 20 performances.
Those will include Irish music, classical music satire, big band _
even a ballet on ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, we have said we would expand the range of cultural
fare offered to the community,'' said Paul Beard, managing director
of Performing Arts Fort Worth and Bass performance hall. ``We got
the cream of what's available in touring groups. It adds a little
spice to the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual attractions will be the St. Petersburg
State Ice Ballet, which will present performances of ``Romeo and
Juliet on Ice'' on April 13 and 14. According to Beard, the ice
ballet company travels with the equipment to produce and maintain a
sheet of ice on the stage for the performance. He said that the
production is specifically designed for presentation in facilities
such as Bass performance hall.
</P>
<P>
   The guest attractions will be marketed in three subscription
series named ``Performance Takes Wing,'' ``Under the Great Dome''
and ``Feathers of Gold,'' inspired by the hall's interior dome,
prominent feather design motif and winged angels on the facade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ice ballet, the season will range from the
New England Spiritual Ensemble (a vocal group specializing in the
performance of traditional African-American spirituals) to
legendary comic Milton Berle to pianist-humorist Victor Borge.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Irish music will be represented by the Chieftains,
winners of four Grammy awards. Contemporary dance will be
represented by the New York-based Parsons Dance Company, famous for
its high-energy, often humorous performances. The musical
avant-garde will be represented by the Philip Glass Ensemble in
``Monsters of Grace,'' a collaboration of composer Glass with
director Robert Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Subscriptions for separate seven-event series range from $81 to
$247.50, depending on seat location and which series is purchased.
Subscriptions will go on sale tomorrow, and single tickets will go
on sale Aug. 25. Single tickets will cost $12 to $50. For
information on subscription purchases, call 212-4280.
