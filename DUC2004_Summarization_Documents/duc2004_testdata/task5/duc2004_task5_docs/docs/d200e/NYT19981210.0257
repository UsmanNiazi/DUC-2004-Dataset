`MONSTERS OF GRACE': SHOCK OF THE SURREAL IN AN EERIE DIGITAL
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ The ineffable slow motion with which events unfold in
``Monsters of Grace,'' the ``digital opera in three dimensions''
that opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night,
would be enough to explain why the piece has taken eight months to
get here since its opening in Los Angeles: 10 miles a day is about
the speed of the thing.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the project, the latest collaboration between
Robert Wilson and Philip Glass, creators of ``Einstein on the
Beach,'' is also being realized at this snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, only seven of the 13 images in Wilson's scenario
could be shown, as intended, by means of computer-animated film
(the rest were staged). Now all 13 are up and running, though some
of them still look decidedly sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Two simply present gliding rods of white or black in severe
geometry on a background of Wilson blue. Other sequences,
especially one that shows several objects on a tray, are merely
essays in technique.
</P>
<P>
   Still others descend oddly and abruptly from the silent sublime
that is Wilson's forte. A dragonfly skims out from a riverbank and
stays for a moment just over the heads of people three or four rows
ahead. And this same scene ends with a sea monster that is about to
devour a floating house and its nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   More general problems include the uncomfortableness of the
cardboard 3-D viewer for those who already wear glasses and the
fact that you have to keep your head at the correct angle to get
the effect.
</P>
<P>
   The best individual sections come earlier. What is perhaps the
most effective of all shows a suburban corner at dusk, and later a
boy slowly cycling toward the audience.
</P>
<P>
   There is a real sense here of a three-dimensional world seen
through a window just behind the musicians, members of the Philip
Glass Ensemble _ an eerie digital world of homogenized shapes and
textures. As the scene proceeds, lights come on in the houses, but
the climax, if that is not too intense a word, comes when the boy
loses a boot and reaches out a hand to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot of hands reach out in this piece. An arm plunges
into the ocean. Fingers approach the fur of what looks at first
like a microphone and then like a cat. In another scene, the
process is reversed and a severed hand is reached _ stuck with pins
and subsequently, in a reference to the eyelid moment in ``Un Chien
Andalou,'' lanced with a scalpel. Touch would seem to be the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the sense of touch is vital in the verse by the
13th-century Persian poet Jelaluddin Rumi (translated by Coleman
Barks) that Glass sets in his music. ``If you want to hold the
beautiful one, hold yourself to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensuality is the touchstone of the spiritual life. But if
Wilson sometimes caresses the eyes, Glass rarely shows such
tenderness for the ears. After the overture, he has a striking
gesture of bellowing from two bass flutes in their bottom register,
a gesture that returns once again.
</P>
<P>
   Another beautiful sound suggests an Islamic bowed instrument
with sympathetic strings being sampled or imitated, though this
section soon lapses musically into travel-feature banality. And
this is the only section in the score that directly responds to the
culture from which the words come.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Glass works with his usual means: repetitions worked
on arpeggios and scales, undifferentiated amplified timbres and
backing-singer vocal style. This is not _ so far, at least _ his
most inventive score.
</P>
<P>
   As always, though, his music fits excellently with Wilson's
contribution. Just as the film, at its best, suggests a nicely
sinister children's picture book, so the score seems to be taking
its own scalpel to nursery rhymes and game songs.
</P>
<P>
   The performers are a vocal quartet (Marie Mascari, Alexandra
Montano, Gregory Purnhagen and Peter Stewart) with a small ensemble
of woodwind and keyboard players, which includes the composer and
which Michael Riesman directs.
