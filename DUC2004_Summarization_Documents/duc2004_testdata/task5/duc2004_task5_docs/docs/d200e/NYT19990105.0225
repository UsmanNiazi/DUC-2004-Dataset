   NEW YORK _ By the late 1970s, Philip Glass was poised to conquer
the mainstream. ``Einstein on the Beach,'' of 1976, a non-narrative
music-theater work created with the director Robert Wilson, had
solidified his reputation in the downtown arts community. It had
also served to clarify and codify Glass' distinctive language. Now
he was firmly in control of his materials and could turn them to
new goals.
</P>
<P>
   The first was to capitalize further on his obvious flair for the
theater. With remarkable facility, he explored new media like film,
dance and opera. Even today, he remains fascinated with
experimental hybrids of music and theater. ``Monsters of Grace,'' a
loose collaboration with Wilson, was given its premiere last month
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Billed as the ``first 3-D digital
opera,'' it promised revelation but delivered only titillation,
since its special effects seemed marginal to both scenario and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' immersion in the theater had a profound impact on his
style. In the 1980s, his music grew more expansive, its structure
looser, its content more intuitive. The years of defiantly
repetitive and radically reductive Minimalism were over.
</P>
<P>
   Newly confident in his abilities, Glass took barely six months
in 1979 to compose what may be his finest opera, ``Satyagraha,'' a
lyrical reflection on Gandhi's formative years in South Africa. And
in 1981, he wrote his finest film score, for Godfrey Reggio's
``Koyaanisqatsi,'' making a breakthrough to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   A studio recording of music from ``Koyaanisqatsi'' was released
in 1984 on Antilles, but to fit on one LP, the score was cut to 46
minutes. Two movements were omitted, and the remaining six were
drastically shortened, usually by curtailing repetitions. The
complete soundtrack was available only in video versions of the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Now the score has been restored to its original glory. A new
recording (Nonesuch 79506-2; CD), running 72 minutes, regains the
expansive pace, grand sweep and formal integrity that were the
essence of both the film and the music. And on Saturday evening,
``Koyaanisqatsi'' will be screened at BAM, with Glass and his
ensemble performing the score live.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' music for ``Koyaanisqatsi'' has only gained in stature
over 18 years. Indeed, it could even be considered his first
orchestral score. As such, it makes a striking contrast with one of
his more recent works, the Symphony No. 2, of 1994, also recorded
by Nonesuch (79496-2; CD), with Dennis Russell Davies conducting
the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' a Hopi word, translates roughly as ``life out
of balance.'' The film shows faceless hordes of commuters and
bureaucrats moving at a frantic pace, imprisoned by technology,
divorced from a ravaged environment. Set against this urban
nightmare are various traditional cultures, whose graceful balance
and timeless rituals are rooted in the rhythms of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, this naive premise proves plausible on screen, partly
because ``Koyaanisqatsi'' does not preach. Devoid of dialogue, text
and narrative, ``Koyaanisqatsi'' lets the images speak for
themselves and allows viewers to draw their own conclusions. And
Reggio's images are unforgettable: sweeping, aerial views of grand,
pristine landscapes; gritty shots of poverty and pollution;
time-lapse footage sped up to turn hyperkinetic city dwellers into
veritable automatons.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of dialogue, Glass' score was always front and
center; it had to be strong enough to lead an independent life.
Perhaps that is why ``Koyaanisqatsi'' showed, for the first time,
Glass' symphonic aspirations. Those had been thoroughly obscured by
the segmentation of the material on the original LP. Only now is
the tightly knit large-scale structure apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The core of ``Koyaanisqatsi'' remains the winds and keyboards of
the Philip Glass Ensemble. But the ensemble is supplemented by a
larger group of low brasses and strings (without violins), and a
wordless vocal sextet. Though hardly a conventional orchestra, this
ensemble represents a big step toward Glass' subsequent embrace of
the orchestral tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The range of instrumental colors is astonishing. If one
particular timbre has come to characterize ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' it is
the dark, subterranean growl that opens and closes the score.
First, low strings and organ sustain open fifths; next, slow,
mournful arpeggios unfurl above; finally, a sepulchral bass voice
solemnly intones the title. Yet ``Koyaanisqatsi'' also shimmers,
especially when brilliant, whirling arpeggios in the high winds and
organ emerge like shafts of sunlight breaking through dark clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the score maintains a melancholy tone, as if resigned to
the fact that Reggio's battle against technology has already been
lost. Glass makes no attempt to mimic Reggio's visuals, but his
trademark vocabulary _ rapid arpeggios, syncopated rhythms and
repeated bass figures _ is well suited to both kinetic and static
imagery. What may appear to be repetition is more illusory than
real, since some aspect of the music always changes, however
subtly.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' score has countless thrilling moments: the richly
sonorous brass ensemble that opens ``Cloudscape'' and ``The Grid'';
the desolate unison of ``Organic,'' growing into stark two-part
counterpoint; the ethereal vocal ensemble of ``Vessels''; the
untamed violence of ``Pruit Igoe.'' ``The Grid,'' maniacal and
propulsive, dominates ``Koyaanisqatsi.'' Now enlarged from the LPs
13 minutes to its full 21, it is not one second too long.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those involved with the original LP _ the Philip Glass
Ensemble; the Western Wind, a vocal ensemble, and Albert de Ruiter,
a bass _ also appear here. Both performances are sharply etched and
consistently inspired, despite Nonesuch's claim that the new
recording demonstrates an ``infinitely greater surety and
dexterity.'' The reason to buy this disk is not because the
performers have matured but because a masterpiece we thought we
knew has been transformed.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Back in 1981, Glass' patented arpeggios and syncopations sounded
fresh and exhilarating, the work of an inspired composer eager to
broaden his language. If only they were similarly vibrant in the
Symphony No. 2, of 1994. But here they are placed in a different
context, which radically alters their impact.
</P>
<P>
   No one can accuse the symphony of lacking ambition. Some 42
minutes long, it is clearly intended to be a major statement.
Unlike the Symphony No. 1, which is based on themes from David
Bowie's album ``Low,'' this work is entirely abstract. What's more,
Glass considers it a study in bitonality, a descendant of music
written in France between the wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in the ambiguous qualities that can result
from polytonality,'' he writes, ``how what you hear depends on how
you focus your ear, how a listener's perception of tonality can
vary in the fashion of an optical illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first movement, bitonal relationships produce gently
dissonant, pungent harmonies. The resulting chromatic language is
new for Glass. But his interest in bitonality wanes in the two
movements that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the symphony offers little that is new and much that
is routine. It opens promisingly enough, with a poignant, lyrical
melody in the English horn. Basically an ascending and descending
scale, the theme reappears countless times throughout the work in
various guises. It is the only distinctive material in the
17-minute first movement, which uses it as the basis for a series
of continuous variations.
</P>
<P>
   The second movement is barely distinguishable from the first,
with neither tonality nor tempo changing significantly. A varied
form of the scalar theme alternates, all too predictably, with new,
noisy syncopations. The last movement begins with genuinely
contrasting gamelanlike patterns, but its main purpose is to allow
Glass to circle back to the motto theme and whip it up to a
suitable climax. (Shades of Dvorak's ``New World'' Symphony?)
</P>
<P>
   Glass strives hard to achieve a grand, brassy apotheosis, but
the gentle little theme cannot support all the bluster. And here
lies the problem with much of his recent instrumental music.
</P>
<P>
   In his works of the 1970s, the repetitive Minimalist patterns
were played by a lean, strident amplified ensemble, and they sound
shocking and defiant even today. In a later work like
``Koyaanisqatsi,'' the same patterns, given to a larger but still
unconventional ensemble, retain much of their sharp edge, motor
energy and obsessive power.
</P>
<P>
   But when these burbling arpeggios, ascending and descending
scales, predictable syncopations and repeated bass figures are
inflated to symphonic proportions, an awkward disparity arises
between Minimalist gestures and Romantic expressive aspirations.
With material of insufficient weight to support the large edifice
built atop it, the symphony falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glass' style is inherently antisymphonic. With
simple patterns frozen into unvarying eight-bar phrases, there is
no rhythmic momentum, development or sense of climax. In Glass'
operas, the narrative provides direction, but here the structure is
merely episodic, with no compelling thrust or cumulative impact.
</P>
<P>
   The vast resources of the orchestra tempt Glass to thicken the
stew unnecessarily. Minimal materials are clothed in absurdly
maximal garb. This contradiction also plagues orchestral works by
other first-generation minimalists, including Steve Reich and Terry
Riley.
</P>
<P>
   At least Reich acknowledged the problem. Since 1987, he has
shunned the orchestra and returned to spare, unconventional
ensembles. Undoubtedly he recognized that his intricate
counterpoint, so crystalline when played by a small group, can turn
muddy when orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, for his part has written marvelous music in recent years,
but none of it has been orchestral. ``Orphee,'' based on the film
by Jean Cocteau, is a small-scale opera scored for a lean,
transparent chamber ensemble. The Fifth String Quartet, startling
in its harmonic and formal innovations, is cast in a medium that
shuns grandiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years after its composition, ``Koyaanisqatsi'' has lost
none of its vitality, for its musical materials are at home in
their environment. Life, in other words, is in balance. But in the
Symphony No. 2, life has swung out of balance, with the materials
mired in alien terrain.
