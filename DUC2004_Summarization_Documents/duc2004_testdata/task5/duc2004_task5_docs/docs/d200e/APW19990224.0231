	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patti Smith had a simple question at a Tibet  
benefit: Trey what? 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, R.E.M., Sean Lennon, Shawn Colvin, Philip Glass and the  
shaggy-haired Trey Anastasio, lead guitarist for Phish, performed 
Monday night at Carnegie Hall to mark the Tibetan New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of Phish showed up in audible force for Anastasio's solo  
appearance. When Glass invited him on stage for a guitar and piano 
duet, the venerable hall was filled with screaming fans chanting 
``Trey!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also got the ``Trey!'' treatment and joked: ``Trey what? A  
tray of cold cuts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were still cries of ``Trey!'' when Tibetan performance  
artists Chaksam-Pa took the stage. ``Trey needs a break,'' one 
member said. The group then performed a traditional Tibetan song 
about respecting elders.
