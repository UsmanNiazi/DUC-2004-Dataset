<HEADLINE> Highway May Be Named After Autry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Gene Autry's legacy as America's original  
singing cowboy extends beyond the dusty trails, and the late star 
may get a highway interchange named after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few offramps east of Bob Hope Drive and 110 miles from  
the Gene Autry Trail desert thoroughfare, Gene Autry Memorial 
Interchange would unite Interstate 5 and Highway 134. The location 
is a short gallop from the Gene Autry Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was announced Tuesday by state Sen. Adam Schiff, who  
said he plans to introduce a resolution to name the interchange 
after Autry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene Autry was a pioneering star in the early days of music,  
radio, film, television and rodeo performances. I am proud to 
posthumously honor such an inspiring role model,'' said Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Autry died Oct. 2 after a long illness, three days after his  
91st birthday.
