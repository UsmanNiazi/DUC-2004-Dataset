   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I was maybe 6-years-old, 7 tops.
</P>
<P>
   The president was an old bald guy named Eisenhower, who'd been a
soldier once. The heavyweight champion of the world was Rocky
Marciano, from up around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest movie star in the world was John Wayne. The hottest
singer around was somebody named Patti Page, who sang about doggies
in windows. And there was this boring guy on our 12-inch,
black-and-white Emerson television set at least a couple of nights
a week. His name was Arthur Godfrey. He played a ukulele.
</P>
<P>
   That was what the world was like the day that Gene Autry knocked
me out cold. And _ it scares me to think about it _ but I remember
it like it was yesterday. Those were the thoughts that hit me the
other night. I was listening to the radio when the news came on.
Gene Autry was dead at 91.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself, ``He was how old? Good God!''
</P>
<P>
   The wanton hours fly past. Mark Twain said that. Or maybe I just
think it was he who said it because I grew up in the town where he
spent much of his life. You think of Mark Twain, and you think of
the Mississippi. But he was a struggling writer with a terrific
line of bullfeathers who'd married the richest woman in Elmira,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Twain lived out his days in my home town, sucking up bourbon and
scribbling on the old lady's dime. When I was a kid, the downtown
hotel was named after him. That's where Autry knocked me cold.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I ought to explain that.
</P>
<P>
   Autry came to town to put on a few shows at the Colonial
Theater, only a block from where Twain's house had stood. The city
fathers, in their wisdom, had long before permitted the house to be
torn down and a shopping plaza to be erected on its site. But
Autry's only interest in anything remotely connected to Mark Twain
was the hotel bar, the Connecticut Yankee Lounge, to which he
retreated between shows.
</P>
<P>
   My mother had taken me to one of those show. Afterwards, she'd
dragged me across the street to the hotel restaurant for ice cream.
Then Autry himself had entered, with his cowboy hat and his camel
hair overcoat. He retreated to the bar for sustenance before
cruising back across the street for the next show.
</P>
<P>
   When Autry came in, I was so excited that I spit ice cream clear
across the table. My mother ordered me to settle down, but I
couldn't. I kept slipping away from the table to peek through the
swinging doors to the bar and watch Autry slug down manhattans. He
never did that in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Autry got up, threw some bills on the bar and hit those
swinging doors, catching me right between the eyes. I went out like
a light. First graders have glass jaws.
</P>
<P>
   I awakened to see Autry against a wall, wide-eyed, with my
mother about to rip him into shreds while a frantic waiter pleaded
with her to, ``Please, lady, calm down.'' Finally, she did, and
Autry hustled out of the place like it was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of her life, my mother never had a good word to say
about Autry. I always liked the guy, although not as much as Roy
Rogers, my very first hero, who died in July. I met him once, too,
in 1974, in one of his restaurants on Long Island. I was surprised
to discover that Roy Rogers was sort of a little guy _ very
gracious and polite, but short. My mother wasn't very big, either.
</P>
<P>
   But she probably could have kicked his butt, too.
