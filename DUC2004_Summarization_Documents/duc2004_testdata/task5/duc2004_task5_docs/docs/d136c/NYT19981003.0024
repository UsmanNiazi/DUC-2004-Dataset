   LOS ANGELES -- Gene Autry was as big a hero in real life as he
was on the big screen, say those who knew ``America's favorite
singing cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very simple person, with a terrific sense of humor,''
said Alex Gordon, director of licensing for Gene Autry
Entertainment, which oversees the singer's four music companies,
films, TV shows and videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved jokes and stories. He didn't care for any fancy
trappings, either in real life or on the big screen. He never had
any airs about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was among scores of friends, fans and celebrities who
mourned Autry's death Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Jeffries, jazz and country music legend, said he will miss
Autry's humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at his accomplishments and life, we'll see a man
who looked at human beings as one race -- the human race,'' said
Jeffries, who made a special trip to the Autry Museum of Western
Heritage in Griffith Park, near downtown L.A., to say goodbye to
his friend. ``He will always be a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the charismatic Army general who led U.S. troops
during Operation Desert Storm in 1990, entertainer Bob Hope called
Autry the ``Norman Schwarzkopf of the Old West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He accomplished nearly every man's dream -- to own a baseball
team,'' Hope said. ``With his song `Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer,' he'll always have an exclusive franchise on Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt
Disney Co., recalled Autry's long association with the
entertainment giant's founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt and Gene were close, and they shared a vision of Southern
California as a major entertainment center -- and they both made
that happen,'' Eisner said, noting that Disney sat on the original
board of directors for the Angels baseball team Autry owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene had a great commitment to the country's youth, and his
examples of kindness and good will are countless,'' he added. ``We
have lost a great entertainer and a great American.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Maltin, ``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic and editor
of the annual ``Movie &AMP; Video Guide,'' recalled Autry's long,
successful career, which spanned generations and included radio, TV
and the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty incredible career,'' Maltin said. ``Today we
measure success in short spurts. Then you look at his decades of
success in every conceivable facet of show business, from personal
appearances to records to movies to TV to sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people forget he had a weekly radio show for 17 years. He
even got an Oscar nomination for co-writing a song (``Be Honest
With Me,'' from the film ``Ridin' on a Rainbow,'' in 1941).
</P>
<P>
   Fans who grew up watching the gentleman cowboy on the silver
screen visited the museum Friday to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Leigh, 53, recalled meeting the singing legend in 1995 at
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the thrill of a lifetime,'' the suburban Studio City
resident said. ``It was like meeting one of your heroes who is
larger than life. And even though he's not here anymore, he'll
always be bigger than life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Ginsberg, 81, said Autry served as a role model for
children of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked me over with a feather,'' said Ginsberg of his
reaction to Autry's death. ``I liked his whole moral fiber. To me,
Gene was the kind of role model we need -- not the kind we got in
Washington right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said America still has Autry, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has left a legacy of recordings, music, videos and this
museum,'' Gordon said. ``He's alive for another generation of
kids.''
