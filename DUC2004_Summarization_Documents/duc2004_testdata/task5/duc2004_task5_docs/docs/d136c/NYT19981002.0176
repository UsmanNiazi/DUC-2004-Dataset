   Gene Autry, America's first singing cowboy of the movies and a
multimillionaire businessman, died Friday at his home in the Studio
City neighborhood of Los Angeles, said Karla Buhlman, vice
president of Gene Autry Entertainment. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   With his theme song, ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' and riding
his chestnut stallion, Champion, Autry began his climb to fame in
the mid-1930s. Although he later owned hotels, broadcasting
stations, oil wells and a baseball team, he did not give up
performing in films, on radio and television or in his own rodeo
until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest recording hit, ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,''
released in 1949, remains a children's Christmas favorite. It has
sold an estimated 15 million copies and is the second best-selling
single in history, runner-up to Bing Crosby's ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a prolific songwriter, turning out some 300 tunes,
including ``Here Comes Santa Claus.'' ``That Silver-Haired Daddy of
Mine,'' another original, was his first recording, a hit that sold
more than a million copies in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's career as a businessman went back to his movie days when
he began making money franchising his name and face for
sweatshirts, jeans, belts, suspenders, gloves, lassos and
souvenirs. By 1940, Gene Autry cap pistols dominated the toy gun
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1948, when he bought a radio station in
Phoenix, that he laid the cornerstone of a financial empire that
included 10 radio stations and a Los Angeles television station, a
flying school, a music-publishing company, a 20,000-acre cattle
ranch in Arizona and ownership of the California Angels baseball
team in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Autry owned the Gene Autry Hotel in Palm Springs,
Calif., and controlled corporations that at times operated a
half-dozen other hotels, including the St. Francis in San
Francisco. He was also a partner in many Oklahoma and Texas oil
well operations.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, who continued to wear Western boots and clothes long
after his retirement from show business, came by his cowboy image
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Orvon Gene Autry was born on Sept. 29, 1907, on a small cattle
and grain farm in Tioga, Texas. He was the son of a cattle buyer,
tenant farmer and nondenominational itinerant preacher. The boy's
mother died when he was 4 years old, not long after the family had
moved to Ravia, Okla., where the young Autry learned to ride horses
and play the guitar and sing at his father's church services.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 16 he went to work as a baggage handler at the
Ravia railroad depot, where he learned telegraphy from the station
master. Later he was a vacation relief telegrapher for the Frisco
Railroad at stops from St. Louis to southern Oklahoma, an
experience that he said was to ``change my life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   One night in Chelsea, Okla., when he was 17, he said, ``This
farmer-looking guy, with glasses on the tip of his nose, came into
the office and gave me some pages to send.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he spotted the guitar,'' Autry said. `` `You play that?'
he asked. `Like to hear you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man Autry dutifully played for turned out to be Will Rogers,
and he told the young man that he had a future on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Thus encouraged, in 1927 Autry used his railroad pass to visit
New York, where he spent a month knocking on the doors of radio
stations and record companies. He was advised to get radio
experience elsewhere, and shortly afterward got a job as Oklahoma's
Yodeling Cowboy on station KVOO in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Autry returned to New York to record ``Silver-Haired
Daddy,'' written with Jimmy Long, a fellow railroad worker, whose
niece, Ina Mae Spivey, he was to marry in 1932. The success of the
recording won Autry a Columbia Records contract and a weekly role
on the popular National Barn Dance radio show broadcast from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Autrys moved to Hollywood in 1934. He was given a small role
in a Ken Maynard western, ``In Old Santa Fe,'' and sang only one
song, but the idea of a singing cowboy hero caught on with
producers at Republic Pictures, which specialized in low-budget
westerns and serials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Autry, beginning with ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds,'' his
first starring role, made eight hourlong movies for the Saturday
afternoon ``kiddie trade.'' In the years to come he appeared in
dozens more, and he became the only western star to be listed by
moviehouse owners as among the top 10 money makers in the Hollywood
films of 1938 to 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In such movies as ``Boots and Saddles,'' ``South of the
Border,'' ``Melody Ranch'' and ``Down Mexico Way,'' Autry was a
no-nonsense hero in stories that conformed to his own cowboy's
code: ``The hero must not take unfair advantage of anyone,
including the bad guys. He must not hit anybody smaller than
himself. He must always keep his word. He must not smoke or drink
in public, and he must not kiss the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His well-trained Tennessee walking horse Champion, which figured
prominently in most Autry movies, had its own stand-in. The famous
horse was replaced through the years with two others from the same
strain from the same breeder near Nashville. In movies and the
traveling Autry rodeo show, Champion was billed as the ``World's
Wonder Horse.'' Smiley Burnett was popular as Autry's comic
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, whose songs, performed in a pleasant tenor voice, irked
some of his younger viewers who preferred nonstop action, had
millions of female fans who wrote 5,000 letters a week to him. But
he was modest about his talents, telling an interviewer in 1980:
``I honestly never considered myself an actor. An actor would be
someone like Paul Muni or Spencer Tracy. I was more of a
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1942, when he enlisted in the Army Air Forces, Autry was
grossing more than $600,000 a year from movies, records, a weekly
radio show and personal appearances. Having learned to fly years
earlier, he spent the war ferrying cargo in the Far East and was
discharged in 1945. The only concession the Air Forces made to
Sergeant Autry's fame was to allow him to wear his cowboy boots
with his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   During his wartime absence, Republic Pictures had promoted Roy
Rogers as King of the Cowboys, so Autry did not return to his old
studio, preferring to form his own Flying A Productions as a unit
at Columbia Pictures. After the war, he took on a new partner, Pat
Buttram, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Flying A made his movies from then on and in the 1950s filmed 91
half-hour episodes of ``The Gene Autry Show'' for CBS and a new
generation of American youngsters. The highly lucrative Autry
company also produced ``Annie Oakley,'' ``Death Valley Days'' and
other television series.
</P>
<P>
   Autry credited his wife, Ina Mae, with inducing him to make one
of his shrewdest decisions. He had received a catchy song in the
mail in 1949 but was reluctant to record it. Mrs. Autry, however,
told her husband: ``It reminds me of `The Ugly Duckling.' Kids will
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recording session in Los Angeles, he suddenly decided to
include the song, ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' and performed
it in a single take. His personal earnings from that single
recording came to more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Autry had no children. His first wife, Ina Mae, died in 1980,
and the next year he married Jacqueline Ellam. She was a
39-year-old friend of 15 years who was a vice president of a bank
in Cathedral City, Calif., near Palm Springs, where Autry had a
home.
</P>
<P>
   If Autry was shrewd in his entertainment career, he had a Midas
touch in business. In 1982, for example, he sold television station
KTLA in Los Angeles for $245 million. Even while still playing
Madison Square Garden in New York and other cities with his own
rodeo shows, he was making deals for oil wells, hotels, radio and
television stations and other properties. He was on the telephone
constantly, keeping in touch with his far-flung interests, but he
was admired for his ability to delegate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Autry was a longtime collector of Western memorabilia and art,
and in December 1988, the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, built
largely with funds from Autry's foundations, opened in Griffith
Park in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I owed something,'' Autry said. ``The West has
been very kind to me over the years.'' Among the items in the $54
million museum are an 1870s-era steam fire engine from Nevada, guns
owned by Annie Oakley and Wyatt Earp and costumes of the Lone
Ranger and Tonto.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the California Angels, now the Anaheim Angels,
Autry, who had been a baseball fan since childhood, was fiercely
competitive. He spent lavishly, offering multi-million-dollar
contracts to attract star players to his team. In 1979 his costly
lineup of stars won Autry and the Angels their first divisional
championship. Known affectionately as the Cowboy in baseball
circles, Autry was one of the most popular owners among players on
his own and other teams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Autry announced that the Walt Disney Co. was buying a
part interest in the team, and the next year Disney took operating
control. Recent baseball seasons ended as all seasons have ended
for the Angels, with Autry still awaiting the team's first World
Series appearance. Disney had an agreement to acquire Autry's
remaining share of the team at his death.
