   Broadcasting, baseball, and show business lost a legend Friday
when Gene Autry, the genial singing cowboy who climbed down from
his saddle and onto the perennial list of America's wealthiest men,
died at his home near Los Angeles. Mr. Autry was 91 and reportedly
had been in ill health for some time.
</P>
<P>
   His death came only weeks after that of cowboy singer Roy Rogers
and a few days after Mr. Autry's Anaheim Angels lost their bid for
a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   His passing ended a colorful, multifaceted career that spanned
seven decades and many media. For anyone who grew up in the 1930s,
'40s, or '50s, Mr. Autry was the living embodiment of the American
West _ a star so transcendent that Hollywood's Walk of Fame needed
five stars to represent his accomplishments, from radio to rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa battling for the home run
season record this year, Mr. Autry and Rogers once dueled in
spirited but friendly fashion for the title of King of the Movie
Cowboys. Mr. Autry, who got there first, appeared in more than 90
films between 1934 and 1956, when he retired from performing. In
1940, theater exhibitors voted Mr. Autry the fourth-biggest box
office draw in the country, trailing only Mickey Rooney, Clark
Gable, and Spencer Tracy. His horse Champion was almost as popular
a figure as Mr. Autry.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the US Army Air Corps in World War II, Mr. Autry
lost some of his star power to Rogers, who filled in for Mr. Autry
at Republic Studios. While Rogers and his wife, Dale Evans,
galloped to stardom, they never seriously challenged Mr. Autry's
supremacy as an all-around entertainer and shrewd businessman. Mr.
Autry's cowboy image lingered indelibly after he took off his chaps
and put on a business suit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Cash, the venerable country singer, once said in tribute:
``When I saw my first Gene Autry movie as a child, I was filled
with awe and wonder for the handsome man with the white hat riding
a beautiful horse. He confirmed the hope instilled in me by my
parents, that good can triumph over evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Autry was born in Tioga, Texas, and grew up in Ravia, Okla.,
20 miles east of the town now known as Gene Autry, Okla. Earning
spending money singing in local nightspots, he bought a $5
mail-order guitar and taught himself some chords. Later, working as
a railroad telegrapher, Mr. Autry met Will Rogers, who encouraged
him to take a shot at radio.
</P>
<P>
   A radio and recording star by the time he found fame on the big
screen, Mr. Autry made 635 recordings and sold 60 million records
during an enormously successful singing career, putting his
songwriter's pen and mellow voice to such hit tunes as ``Mexicali
Rose,'' ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' even ``Rudolph the Red-nosed
Reindeer.'' ``Here Comes Santa Claus'' and ``Peter Cottontail'' are
other holiday-themed hits that have woven Mr. Autry's music into
the fabric of American family life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Mr. Autry made yet another enterprising transition,
this time from films to television. He produced and starred in many
popular offerings of the early '50s, including ``The Gene Autry
Show,'' ``Annie Oakley,'' and ``The Adventures of Champion.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he indulged his love for baseball _ Mr. Autry had once
passed up a chance to play minor league baseball _ by starting the
California Angels franchise in the American League. The Angels
never won a pennant. The closest they came was in 1986, when they
were a Dave Henderson ninth-inning home run away from beating the
Red Sox and advancing to the World Series. Yet in the often
fractious world of big-league baseball, Mr. Autry was as beloved
and respected a figure as he had once been crooning ``Under Western
Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all Americans, I grew up with him, and when I became an
adult I learned he was a brilliant entrepreneur,'' said TV producer
Dick Clark Friday. ``I'll always harbor this secret feeling that he
gave up when the Angels didn't make it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Autry, who retained a stake in the club when he sold
operating control of the Angels to the Walt Disney Co. in 1995,
made several fortunes in and out of baeball and show business. His
real estate holdings included the Gene Autry Hotel in Palm Springs,
Calif., and Los Angeles TV station KTLA, which he sold in 1982 for
$245 million.
</P>
<P>
   A major collector of Western art and memorabilia, Mr. Autry
founded the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in 1988, located in
Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The museum's $54 million collection
includes guns owned by Annie Oakley and Wyatt Earp. In 1995, Forbes
magazine pegged Autry's net worth at $320 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Autry is survived by his wife, Jackie, and a sister, Veda,
along with several nieces and nephews. Funeral services at Forest
Lawn Cemetery will be private.
</P>
<P>
   Eulogies for Mr. Autry will surely make reference to the cowboy
code by which he lived. As Mr. Autry saw it: ``The cowboy must
never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage. He
must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals. He must not
advocate or possess racially or religiously intolerant ideas. He
must respect women, parents, and his nation's laws. The cowboy is a
patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Gene Autry was a cowboy.
