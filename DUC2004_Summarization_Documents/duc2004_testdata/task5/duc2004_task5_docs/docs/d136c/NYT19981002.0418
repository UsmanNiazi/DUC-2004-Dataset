   ANAHEIM -- The Angels retired uniform No. 26 in honor of owner
Gene Autry in 1982, symbolic of him being team's 26th player. It
was a fitting tribute to an owner that truly was part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, who died Friday at age 91, continued to attend Angels
games this season when he could. And whenever he did, he always
went into the clubhouse to visit with the players.
</P>
<P>
   Autry was a regular in the clubhouse during the club's early
years after he bought the team at the baseball winter meetings in
1960. He sold 25 percent and controlling interest in the team to
Disney on May 15, 1996, with the stipulation that his remaining 75
percent interest would be transferred to Disney upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just take for granted a person's going to be
around forever,'' said shortstop Gary DiSarcina, an Angel since
1989. ``Gene was one of those guys. Every time he came through the
clubhouse, he always had a smile on his face. It was one of the
highlights of the day for the guys on the team. I'm going to miss
the jokes and the laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a player's owner. I've always heard since I've been
here, `Let's win one for the Cowboy.' I know the players present
and past meant it. He commanded attention and he commanded respect.
He'll be greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed because I always enjoyed seeing him
around the ballpark,'' said pitcher Chuck Finley, an Angel since
1986. ``I know that whenever his named is mentioned, it brings a
smile to everyone's face. I have a lot of fond memories of all the
stories he'd always tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Angels' battle cry through the years was ``Win one
for the Cowboy,'' they never did. Although the Angels won the
American League West Division in 1979, '82 and '86, they've never
reached the World Series. In 1986, the Angels were one strike away
from going to the World Series before eventually losing a
seven-game series to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team was one of the things that made him happy and I know
he was disappointed we didn't get to the World Series,'' Finley
said. ``But he'd always tell me `As long as you try your best and
work hard, then what happens, happens.' I'm sad we didn't get to
the World Series for him but I'm sure he'll be watching us from
above in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was Autry's passion, and he even tried out for the St.
Louis Cardinals at age 19. He was offered $100 a month, but turned
it down because he was making more than that as a telegrapher at
the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to fame and fortune as America's Singing Cowboy, and
though today's Angels players weren't yet born during his heyday,
they are well aware of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Autry was always my dad's childhood hero and I've been
fortunate enough to be a member of his team,'' said outfielder Tim
Salmon, an Angel since 1992. ``What a privilege I've been given to
know him and to play for his ballclub. I feel so honored to have
had the opportunity to know him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember most was one year when we shot some
promotional commercials,'' said former second baseman Bobby Grich,
an Angel from 1977-86. ``Gene and I were in the runway and he
called me son and I called him dad. That experience remains dearest
to my heart. He is the person most responsible for me playing in
California and coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I remember is that after every road trip, he would
come down to the clubhouse at least once to see how each of us and
our families were doing. He was never aloof and he was the best
owner a ballplayer could work for.''
