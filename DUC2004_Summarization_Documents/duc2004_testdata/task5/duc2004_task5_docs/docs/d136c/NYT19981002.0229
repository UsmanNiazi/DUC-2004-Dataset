   From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram of Saturday, Oct. 3:
</P>
<P>
   With the death of Gene Autry at 91 on Friday, the question once
again is raised: Who was the true King of the Cowboys _ Roy Rogers
or Autry?
</P>
<P>
   Many Johnny-come-lately fans _ especially those who knew them
only from the pap of TV serials _ considered Rogers at the top of
the heap.
</P>
<P>
   In their heyday, it was much less clear cut. For starters, Autry
_ an authentic Texan from Tioga, just north of Denton _ was
Hollywood's first singing cowboy. When he chose to put his career
on hold so he could serve as an Army flier during World War II, his
unsympathetic studio selected a singer with no trace of cowboy
about him as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   That replacement _ Leonard Slye of Cincinnati _ earlier had been
renamed Roy Rogers and remodeled in the Autry image. He was given a
trick horse (like Autry's Champion) and a sidekick (like Autry's
Smiley Burnette). The sidekick, Gabby Hayes, was swiped intact from
fellow cowboy star Wild Bill Elliott. (Rogers' very first role,
1938's ``Under Western Stars,'' was intended for Autry and
co-starred Burnette.)
</P>
<P>
   From 1937 to 1943, Autry was the unchallenged champion western
star at the box office. In 1940-42 he was in the Top 10 of all
movie box office favorites.
</P>
<P>
   As a recording star, Rogers was never a serious challenge to
Autry, who recorded 635 songs, including ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer'' and his signature ``Back in the Saddle Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry, of course, handled the matter like the authentic cowboy
hero that he was. He never uttered a negative word about his rival.
After Rogers died July 6, Autry called it ``a terrible loss for me.
I had tremendous respect for Roy and considered him a great
humanitarian and an outstanding American.''
