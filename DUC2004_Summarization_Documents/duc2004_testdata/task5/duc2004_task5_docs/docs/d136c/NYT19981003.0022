   LOS ANGELES -- Gene Autry, the famed singing cowboy of Saturday
matinee movies, radio and television who built a business empire
that included the Anaheim Angels, died Friday of cancer at his home
in suburban Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   He was 91. His wife, Jacqueline, was at his side, an associate
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great man and humanitarian has just ridden off into the
sunset,'' said entertainer and comedian Bob Hope. ``Gene Autry was
a giant among the men of the 20th century -- a man of many talents,
a man of many interests, a generous man whose heart and wallet
touched millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry, a Renaissance man who traversed the worlds of radio, TV
and the silver screen, made 635 recordings, 94 films, earned five
stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, owned Melody Ranch in suburban
Newhall, and served as a role model to generations of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Autry celebrated his 91st birthday Tuesday. He had battled
lymphoma for several years, said Joanne Hale, the president, chief
executive officer, founder and director of the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage in Griffith Park, near downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said Autry had been bedridden for ``quite a few weeks'' but
was scheduled to attend the museum's annual gala Oct. 16. Instead,
the event will be a tribute to the western star's life and
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Born Orvon Autry on Sept. 29, 1907, on a farm near Tioga, Texas,
he was the first of four children born to Delbert and Elnora Autry.
His father's livelihood, livestock trading, influenced his lifelong
love of western Americana. His mother encouraged his musical
talents. His grandfather, a Baptist minister, had Autry singing in
his church choir at age 5.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny town was split by train tracks, and Autry grew up
fascinated by the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   At an early age, he began working as all-around station
handyman, train dispatcher and apprentice telegraph operator. He
used some of his earnings to buy his first guitar at age 11 for $11
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the depot strumming the instrument one evening several
years later when a man walked in to send a telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pretty good, son, although you do have a lot to learn.
I would suggest you take your guitar and head for the nearest big
radio station,'' Autry recalled the man as saying.
</P>
<P>
   He finished transcribing the telegram, and was startled to learn
the sender's identity -- famed humorist and entertainer Will
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Autry took Rogers' advice, but the Big Apple radio stations
weren't interested in the tenor from Texas. Keeping his day job,
Autry landed his first radio gig at a station in Tulsa and was
billed as ``Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry eventually moved to Chicago, where he earned a four-week
tryout at radio station WLS, which had the most powerful signal in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks stretched into four years. The legend of the singing
cowboy was born.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's first record, ``That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,'' sold
more than 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to make 635 recordings, including more than 200 songs
written or co-written by him. His records sold more than 100
million copies, and he earned more than a dozen gold and platinum
records, including the first record ever certified gold.
</P>
<P>
   He had five million-selling songs, including ``Here Comes Santa
Claus,'' ``Peter Cottontail,'' ``Frosty the Snowman'' and ``Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' the second-biggest single of all time and
Autry's biggest hit.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Melody Ranch'' weekly radio show aired for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   His singing reputation secure, Autry set out to conquer the
silver screen. In time, he would rank among the top 10 box-office
draws, the first western actor to be included in the company of
stars such as Mickey Rooney, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in 94 films, always playing himself. When the Legion
of Decency cracked down on the motion-picture industry in 1934,
Hollywood's answer was a series of musical westerns, made to order
for Autry's clean image.
</P>
<P>
   His first starring film was ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds,'' which came
out in 1935. Autry's westerns de-emphasized violence; used comedic
touches with a sidekick, usually played by Smiley Burnette;
emphasized his singing; featured independent-minded female
characters; and tackled social issues relevant to the time.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, he never drew his gun first, never hit a smaller man.
Only once in all his films did he share a kiss, with actress Ann
Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's appearances at New York's Madison Square Garden were
always sellouts, as were his rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his popularity, it was suggested that his
constant cross-county traveling was wearing him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If show business was easy, everybody would be in it,'' Autry
replied.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   He earned an unsurpassed five stars on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame, and became the first movie star to have a town named after
him _ Berwyn, Okla., became Gene Autry, Okla., in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he enlisted in the Air Force as a pilot and
flew transport supply planes over China, Burma and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he resumed his successful recording career as
well as his half-hour radio show. He started Gene Autry Productions
for films that were distributed by Columbia Pictures, and had his
own record label, Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Autry soon began to amass ownership interests in a wide range of
entities, prompting Forbes magazine to list him among the nation's
400 wealthiest men in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among his holdings were a 20,000-acre ranch in Colorado, hotels
on L.A.'s Sunset Strip and in Palm Springs, and television and
radio stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Tucson,
Seattle and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   He also had an interest in three publishing houses, a flying
school, two newspapers, oil wells and a manufacturing firm licensed
to produce Gene Autry merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Autry bought Rancho Placeritos, in Placerita Canyon
near Newhall, and renamed it Melody Ranch. The ranch, which also
had been known as Monogram Ranch, was a place where other western
movie stars including Tom Mix, William S. Hart, John Wayne and Roy
Rogers had made films.
</P>
<P>
   A brush fire at Melody Ranch in 1962 destroyed historical film
sites, including 54 structures, the western street set and antique
autos and stagecoaches that Autry had collected. After his horse,
Champion, died at the age of 41 in 1990, the last 10 acres of the
ranch were put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's entry into the ranks of baseball owners was set in
motion by the man who would become his cross-town rival, Dodgers
owner Walter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley aired Dodger games over the former KMPC-AM (710), one
of the radio stations Autry owned. But when O'Malley bought a
summer home in Arrowhead, he switched stations, complaining that he
could not get good reception on KMPC during the team's road games.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Hall of Fame outfielder Hank Greenberg and Bill
Veeck Jr., whose father owned the Chicago White Sox, came to Los
Angeles to scout a broadcast outlet for the expansion team they
were considering buying. When the two changed their minds about
acquiring the California Angels franchise, Autry called American
League President Joe Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   Autry telephoned Cronin on a Friday. By Monday, he and his
partner, ex-Stanford football star Bob Reynolds, were in business
after posting a $1.5million letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Autry once said that that first victory would go down as his
sweetest baseball memory, ``until we win a pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry recently sold some of his shares in the team, now the
Anaheim Angels, to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Autry married banker Jacqueline Ellam after the death
of his first wife. Autry met Ellam while doing business with a bank
in Cathedral City, near Palm Springs, where she was an officer.
</P>
<P>
   His best men at the wedding were his lifelong sidekicks _
Hollywood's honorary mayor, Johnny Grant, and actor Pat Buttram of
``Green Acres'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Autry took an active role in her husband's business
dealings, particularly in the operation of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple's pride and joy was the Gene Autry Museum of
Western Heritage, which opened in October 1988 on 13 acres in
Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband felt this city had been so kind to him that he
wanted to say thanks in some small way,'' Jackie Autry told the
Daily News several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The museum chronicles the history of the cowboy, from the 16th
century to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene had always believed the cowboy and the West were the
backbone of American history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his widow, Autry is survived by a sister, Veda
Coppola of suburban Sherman Oaks, as well as several nieces and
nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood
Hills will be private. However, a public memorial is planned in
four to six weeks at the museum, a spokeswoman there said.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that donations be
made to the museum, 4700 Western Heritage Way, Griffith Park.
