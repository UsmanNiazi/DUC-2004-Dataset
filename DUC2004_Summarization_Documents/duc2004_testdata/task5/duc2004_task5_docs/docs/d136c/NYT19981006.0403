<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. is expected to take full control
of the Anaheim Angels by next baseball season after last week's
death of longtime owner Gene Autry.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant bought a 25 percent interest in the club
in May 1995 for an estimated $30 million from the husband-and-wife
team of Gene and Jackie Autry. The deal made Disney managing
partner of the American League team and included an option to buy
the remaining 75 percent once Gene Autry died.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokesman said Autry's passing triggered a 180-day
period in which Disney can exercise the option.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said no decision had been made yet, but sports
consultant David Carter believes Disney will buy the rest of the
team. ``It will be very routine for Disney to exercise the option
because they already have the operating rights,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Bonham, president of the Denver-based Bonham Group sports
consulting company, agreed. ``It's almost guaranteed that Disney
would make a serious attempt to buy the rest of the franchise,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has never disclosed terms for the 1995 deal, but its
payment for the full franchise is likely to represent a major
bargain. Prices for baseball teams have soared in recent years due
to the increasing value placed on sports programming by operators
of TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports still delivers that coveted 18-to-34-year-old male
demographic,'' Carter said. ``Professional sports is the best place
to find that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, based in suburban Burbank, owns the ESPN sports networks
and has operated the Mighty Ducks hockey franchise in Anaheim since
1992. It is paying a whopping $9.2 billion for eight years of
broadcast rights for pro football games on ABC and ESPN, and
recently agreed to spend an estimated $600 million for five years
of National Hockey League broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmarks for franchise values jumped earlier this year with
News Corp.'s $311 million purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers and
$1 billion buyout of the Manchester United soccer team, along with
the $530 million paid for the Cleveland Browns football franchise.
Cablevision Systems recently made a reported $500 million offer for
the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can definitely say that the $30 million that Disney paid
in 1995 was a terrific deal,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham said the recent sales of franchises have thrown the
market into chaos because of the recognition that franchises can be
used as part of an overall corporate strategy to achieve sales and
marketing goals.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said it is likely that Disney's final price will include
credit for the estimated $70 million it spent renovating Anaheim
Stadium, which has been renamed Edison International Field. Total
value of the Angel franchise is probably in the $200 million range,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham said the franchise is worth $150 million
``conservatively, factoring in the sale of the Dodgers and
refurbishment of the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham also said it was likely that the 1995 deal included a
provision to determine the price for the remaining 75 percent. ``I
would not have allowed my client to sign an agreement without a
valuation formula,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry bought the Angels for $2.5 million before the team's
inaugural season in 1961. The club won division titles in 1979,
1982 and 1986 but was never able to advance to the World Series.
