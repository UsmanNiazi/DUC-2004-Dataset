AUTRY WAS AN OWNER WORTH CHEERING

   LOS ANGELES _ If you want to know what made Gene Autry the last
of his kind among baseball club owners, go back to April 1 in
Anaheim and the Angels founder's final on-the-field public
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was opening night at renovated Edison Field, and for a
pre-game ceremony, Autry was driven to mid-diamond in a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   He looked happy, looked splendid in his singing-cowboy suit and
hat. But he was 90 years old, and he was caught off-guard when an
emcee shoved a microphone in his face and asked if he'd like to say
anything to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Autry mumbled for a second. Then he roared, ``I'm back in the
saddle again!''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-thousand fans stood and cheered. Behind Autry, former
Angels applauded. On the dugout steps, current Angels joined the
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same ceremony, Disney chairman Michael Eisner,
whose corporation bought control of the Angels from Autry in 1996
and paid for the glorious new ballpark, was introduced to the crowd
_ and was booed.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry was an owner you could cheer, an institution you
could love, a rich man with whom you could sympathize after his
team's many tantalizing failures.
</P>
<P>
   And when he died Friday morning in Studio City a few days past
his 91st birthday, moving on to a place where the angels never let
you down, a breed of baseball owners vanished from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner and Rupert Murdoch couldn't shine his boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't just an owner,'' Gene Mauch, twice manager of
Autry's Angels, said from his home in Rancho Mirage. ``He was such
a great fan.... That was the attraction, he was so real.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauch would sit for hours with Autry and trade baseball stories.
Mauch, the baseball man, would do most of the listening. Mauch
remembers that Autry, well past middle age at the time, loved how
his stature in the game allowed him to hang out with Mickey Mantle
and Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``As big as he was _ and he was the Babe Ruth of country music,
the Babe Ruth of cowboy movies before he ever got into baseball _
he was the most unassuming person I've ever met,'' Mauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Autry was a businessman, to be sure, parlaying his acting and
singing into television and radio station ownership. He was merely
trying to secure a baseball broadcasting contract for one of his
radio stations when he attended the 1960 major-league owners'
meetings and wound up with the Los Angeles Angels expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels didn't exist to provide programming for Autry's
media outlets, as the Dodgers seem to do for Fox. The Angels became
his life.
</P>
<P>
   He was a rare sports owner, a sportsman at heart. His bottom
line was the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gene, in his best efforts, always wanted to win, and
the players wanted the same,'' former Angels third baseman Doug
DeCinces said, offering a partial explanation for Autry's
popularity in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember is his ability to come through the clubhouse
and have an open smile, and how he truly enjoyed the relationship
with his players. I think because he was an entertainer himself, he
understood what it took to go out there (on the field).''
</P>
<P>
   His stardom gave him an ``in'' with the roughest bunch of
skeptics an owner could encounter _ the fans. If they'd booed Gene
Autry, they'd be booing Santa Claus, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
and Peter Cottontail. He'd sung about them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the Saddle'' was his theme song.
</P>
<P>
   What's Jerry Reinsdorf's theme song?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone could identify with him,'' said Richard Brown,
president of Autry's Angels from 1990 to '96. ``(Young) people
identified with him because they went to his movies and heard his
songs growing up. Older people identified with him as somebody who
came from their era.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a !ital!good person!off!. A lot of people knew
he'd volunteered for World War II, he wouldn't accept a commission,
he was a pilot.... He was Americana. I think that's why people
loved him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, people wanted the Angels to win one for the Cowboy,
and they never could, though Autry retained the title of ``owner''
to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Players and managers choked away 1982, '85, '86 and '95. General
managers frittered away the millions Autry was eager to spend on
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was his biggest disappointment,'' Mauch
said Friday, ``but it was probably the biggest disappointment of my
life, not being able to give him those championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauch recalled Autry's good humor after the Angels blew a
September lead to the Kansas City Royals in '85. That winter,
manager and owner shared the microphone at a dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win again next year, are you still going to love
me?'' Mauch asked Autry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Autry replied. ``And I'm going to miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   If they'd known Autry would live this long, his Angels might
have been more patient, built the roster from the minor leagues up
as Disney is doing, and won a World Series after all.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the TV showed a clip from about a decade ago, from the
last of his record-setting five Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one day that will be bigger than this one for
me,'' Autry said then, ``and that's the day we win the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Made you want to cry, hearing that.
</P>
<P>
   Ever shed a tear for a corporation? &QL;
