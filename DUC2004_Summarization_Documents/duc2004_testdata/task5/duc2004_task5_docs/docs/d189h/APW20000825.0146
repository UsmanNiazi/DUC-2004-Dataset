<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Stricter Gift Rules  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upset over the corporate-sponsored bashes at
the national party conventions earlier this month, two Senate
Democrats want to make future parties off-limits to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin asked the Senate Ethics Committee on Friday to tighten
the rules against accepting gifts and meals from special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers currently can accept meals or gifts valued at $50 or
less, with no more than $100 from a single source. But the rules,
tightened in 1995, do not apply to conventions and other ''widely
attended events.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone and Feingold, who decried the corporate bashes from an
alternative gathering held down the street from the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, said the ethics committee
should remove the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''To allow members to attend such events, which are essentially
gifts with values greater than the current cap, plainly conflicts
with the spirit of the rule, and should not be allowed within its
letter,'' the two senators wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who helped draft the 1995 gift ban, said he and
Feingold will seek a change in the law if the ethics committee does
not change its interpretation. The exemption for ''widely attended
events'' was aimed at meetings with constituents, not parties throw
by corporations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think we're talking about a very different creature here
in Los Angeles, or with the Republicans in Philadelphia,''
Wellstone said. ''There was no official function that senators were
serving.''
</P>
<P>
   In both cities, dozens of corporations and trade groups
sponsored parties honoring lawmakers who sat on the committees that
oversaw their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic and Republican conventions are perfect examples
of how the current campaign finance system works -- senators are
showered with gifts at lavish parties hosted by the same wealthy
interests with business before the Congress,'' said Feingold, the
co-sponsor of legislation to change the way campaigns are funded.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he doesn't expect a very good reception from
fellow lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be difficult,'' he said. ''Some people in the House
and Senate will interpret it as bashing. But the reason for the
gift ban is it's not appropriate for us to receive gifts from
people who come before us. It's a violation of the legislation we
passed.''
