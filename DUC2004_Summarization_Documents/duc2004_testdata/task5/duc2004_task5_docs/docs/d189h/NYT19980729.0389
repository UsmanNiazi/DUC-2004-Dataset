 &HT;    HOUSE APPROVES LOW-LEVEL NUCLEAR DUMP SITE IN TEXAS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting pleas to protect a poor West Texas town
from becoming the ``nation's dumping ground,'' the House approved a
bill Wednesday allowing the transfer of low-level radioactive waste
to a site near Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 305-117 to pass the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Compact, a compromise plan approved earlier this
month by a House-Senate conference committee. The measure now goes
to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas delegation voted 21-6 Wednesday to pass the compact.
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee had stripped amendments proposed by
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
including one that would restrict waste from states other than
Texas, Maine and Vermont. The amendment would have delayed the site
because the states would have had to re-ratify the compact.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated such compacts with the Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Policy Act in the 1980s, and has already approved nine
similar compacts involving 42 states, said Rep. Joe Barton,
R-Texas, author of the Texas compact bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other compact has been approved overwhelmingly by
Congress, without change,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was vehemently opposed by Doggett, who said that
Sierra Blanca _ an impoverished and largely Hispanic town _ has
been targeted not for its ``suitability, but its vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chosen because it was perceived that the people of
Sierra Blanca lack the political power to be able to do something
to protect their neighborhood,'' Doggett said on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we are in favor of protecting the people of Texas, or
we are in favor of extending that Texas hospitality a little too
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the House vote, Wellstone reiterated that he would use
``every parliamentary tool available'' to prevent the measure from
passing in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be satisfied until the Texas Compact includes
protections against environmental discrimination and keeps Sierra
Blanca from becoming a national repository for radioactive waste,''
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The dump, which Texas wants to build at a site 90 miles
southeast of El Paso, would house radioactive components from
dismantled nuclear power plants and industrial and medical waste.
The compact would allow Maine and Vermont to ship their waste to
West Texas in exchange for payments of $25 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The House last fall passed the compact with Doggett's amendment,
which limited waste from any other states besides Maine and Vermont
to enter Texas. Wellstone added Doggett's amendment to the Senate
version of the bill _ which passed last April _ but a conference
committee stripped out the amendment earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also removed an amendment that would have allowed
local residents to challenge the dump site if they felt they had
been discriminated against based on race, color, national origin or
income level.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Texas
Republicans, have supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor and the Texas legislature have made a decision,
and he's not going to vote to overturn it,'' said Larry Neal, a
spokesman for Gramm.
