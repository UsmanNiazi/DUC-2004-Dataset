DEMOCRAT HAS HAT IN RING, AND IN HAND, FOR PRESIDENCY

   WASHINGTON _ Publicly, Vice President Al Gore refuses to
acknowledge the obvious: that he is running for president. Other
Democratic and Republican aspirants are also playing coy about
their designs on the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sen. Paul Wellstone: The liberal Democrat from Minnesota is
so unabashed about his ambitions that he was the first candidate to
establish an ``exploratory committee'' as an initial step for a
White House run. Already, the committee has helped finance
Wellstone's travels as part of his drive to build support.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the committee, the senator recently mailed a solicitation
letter to Democrats around the country _ liberals in particular _
asking them to give up to $750 to his committee. In the letter,
Wellstone, a former political science professor who was elected in
1990 and re-elected six years later, sounds out populist themes for
a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve leadership that comes to grips
with bread-and-butter economic issues and takes on powerful
interests,'' he wrote. ``The American people deserve a foreign
policy that truly reflects our democratic ideals and places human
rights at its center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must learn to strike a new balance with nature, conducting
ourselves as though the Earth is a precious gift we hold in trust
for our children and our children's children,'' the letter
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Wellstone got to the heart of his appeal: ``Our campaign
must be the opposite of cynical,'' he wrote. ``We will organize,
galvanize and energize. So I ask you again: Will you join me?'' He
asks for ``a check for $25, $50, $100 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   While many other presidential contenders insist that they are
still mulling over their decisions _ many are expected to announce
their candidacies early next year _ Wellstone noted that the early
primaries in 2000 and the demands for early fund-raising bring the
campaign season closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nov. 7, 2000, probably seems a long time away to you. (It does
to me!),'' he wrote. ``But the realities of present-day
presidential politics demands that any potential candidate who
relies heavily on grass-roots organizing must get started at the
earliest possible moment. That moment is now!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is widely viewed as the overwhelming early favorite for the
Democratic nomination, especially given his position as vice
president, an extensive fund-raising network at his command, and
the fact that, from top to bottom, the White House is behind his
candidacy. While Wellstone is considered a long shot, he is popular
among liberals and is trying to fashion himself as a force in the
process by being the candidate of the left.
</P>
<P>
   For well over a year, Wellstone has traveled the country, trying
to build support for a populist-style campaign. Routinely, he said,
he asked people two questions related to a presidential run: ``Can
I gather the necessary support? Can I raise enough money to run a
competitive campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he said in the letter, ``My travels during the
past year strongly suggest to me that the answer to both those
questions is `Yes.' For the balance of the year, I am committed to
devoting all the time and energy I can to continue traveling across
America to seek those answers.''
