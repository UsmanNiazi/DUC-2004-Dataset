<P>
	A brief look at potential Democratic presidential candidates in  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Al Gore, 50, former member of both the House and the Senate  
from Tennessee, and vice president since 1993. He is considered the 
front-runner for the nomination. He ran unsuccessfully in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Gephardt, 57, House minority leader from Missouri. He shot  
to national prominence in 1988 when he won the Iowa caucuses and 
finished second in the New Hampshire primary, before later dropping 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bill Bradley, 55, basketball star, Rhodes scholar and former  
senator from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paul Wellstone, 54, former college professor and current  
senator from Minnesota. He is a critic of the Clinton 
administration's centrist philosophy and has set himself up as an 
alternative to Gore in much the same way another Minnesota senator, 
Eugene McCarthy, challenged Lyndon Johnson 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--John Kerry, 55, is a Vietnam War hero and 14-year senator from  
Massachusetts. His re-election battle in 1996 against former Gov. 
William F. Weld became a nationally watched race. Kerry won by 7 
percentage points -- a big enough margin to spark talk of a 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jesse Jackson, 57, the nation's best-known civil rights leader,  
is considering a third run for the nomination. He ran 
unsuccessfully in 1984 and 1988.
