<HEADLINE> Wellstone Offers State Health Plans  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the Senate's most liberal members is
proposing a universal health care plan with a Republican twist: Let
states come up with their own plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to have a proposal that fits in the mood set of the
country,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., as he announced the
legislation Wednesday. He said he was trying to avoid the pitfalls
of the failed 1993 Clinton administration plan, which he called
''too complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty-five million Americans have no coverage and we're not
talking about universal health coverage?'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the federal government would provide matching
funds of 70 percent to 75 percent to states, which would devise
their own plans for universal coverage. They could use employer
mandates, single-payer systems, or other ways to achieve it. States
would have to design a plan that guarantees affordable health care
by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Families making less than $25,000 a year would pay no more than
0.5 percent of their income in health care costs; those making
between $25,000 and $50,000 would pay a maximum of 5 percent; and
families making $50,000 or more would pay no more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated his plan would cost $700 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one-third of the (projected) surplus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone unveiled the plan with the Service Employees
International Union, the nation's largest health care union, which
will runs ads during the Republican and Democratic conventions
promoting the need for affordable health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and
political analysis, said it was significant that a liberal Democrat
had offered a plan that is not run by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''In today's America, it's political genius'' to let states
design their own plans, Blendon said, saying such a proposal has a
much better chance of winning Republican support than a centralized
one.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the government couldn't rely on surplus money to
fund the program indefinitely. ''Someday, we'd have to face up to
how we'd pay for it.''
