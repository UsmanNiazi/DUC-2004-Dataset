<HEADLINE> Wellstone Won't Run for White House </HEADLINE>

	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Sen. Paul Wellstone announced Saturday he  
will not run for president in 2000, removing a liberal threat to 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said: `Look, if I can do this presidential race  
and I can also do a good job for people of Minnesota, I'm going to 
do it both,''' the Minnesota Democrat said at a news conference at 
the state Capitol. ``I will admit to you, I don't think I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone said he decided in the last couple of weeks that he  
couldn't take the rigors of a presidential campaign because of 
chronic back pain from a ruptured disk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly always been manageable for Minnesota work. But  
traveling all over the country, constantly in planes and constantly 
in cars and going seven days a week, I don't think I can do that 
and represent Minnesota well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a month ago Wellstone hinted strongly that, after more than  
a year of positioning himself for a White House bid, he was ready 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone also said he would not back off of an early pledge not  
to run for a third Senate term. He was first elected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the most outspoken liberals in Congress and a critic  
of the Clinton administration's centrist philosophy, he had been 
positioning himself as an alternative to Gore, the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey have formed  
exploratory campaign committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., announced last month he would not run,  
and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has not decided 
whether he will seek the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone's advisers dismissed any suggestion that Gore's  
fund-raising and organizational strength intimidated the 
Minnesotan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone's decision ``will take the wind out of the left wing  
of the Democratic Party because Paul was very much their standard 
bearer,'' said Steven Schier, head of the political science 
department at Carleton College in Northfield, where Wellstone 
taught before his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone started laying the groundwork for a presidential  
campaign soon after he won election to a second Senate term in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1997 his national profile began to grow when he  
undertook a six-state ``poverty tour'' that retraced the steps of 
Robert F. Kennedy when he was a presidential contender 30 years 
ago. He also made stops in the early presidential battleground 
states of New Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, he offered bills for a public jobs program and an  
expansion of federal child-care assistance that stood little chance 
of passing in the Republican Congress. But the bills served as an 
appealing campaign platform to fellow liberals.
