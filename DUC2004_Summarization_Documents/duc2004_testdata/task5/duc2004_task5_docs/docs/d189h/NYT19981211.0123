   &UR;  &LR; The last person you want to fight is the one who has nothing
to lose.

   Which is reason enough to keep an eye on Paul Wellstone, the
Minnesota senator running for the Democratic presidential
nomination. He'll be in it, and he doesn't give a hoot who else
gets in the fray. He is the most dangerous kind of opponent in
politics. Because he's a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone is the George McGovern of 1972, the Jimmy Carter of
1976, the Paul Tsongas of 1992. He carries a cause, not just a
candidacy. I'm not saying he'll win the nomination; I'd be shocked
if he did.
</P>
<P>
   But he burns with a clear blue flame, as the true-blue lefty in
the field. He's a professor, a crusader, a born-again-and-again
out-and-out left-wing redistribute-the-wealth guy. He'll pitch to
the liberal band of the Democrats' spectrum, which typically loves
the purest liberal. Democratic primaries always leave room for a
cause candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is the prohibitive favorite; all the
Republican insiders I talk to are convinced Gore will be their
quarry. Senators or ex-senators much taller than Wellstone, with
medals (Bob Kerrey and John Kerry) from war or medals (Olympic)
from basketball (Bill Bradley), paw the turf in Iowa and New
Hampshire. Wellstone, reelected to a second term with barely 51
percent of the vote, is probably the weakest on paper. But his
earnest prairie populism, dogged bread-and-butter politics, prudent
and penny-pinching guerrilla campaign style, will appeal to the
young and the sandal-wearers, two Democratic constituencies not to
be sneezed at in early states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to represent the democratic wing of the Democratic
Party,'' he once cracked in a forum. It got a laugh, and his
baiting of big-money politicians will get lots of laughs. He may be
the conscience of the early debates who'll generate sparks before
he's shouldered aside by big money and brawnier candidacies, with
more centrist messages.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the big media will be the last to get the word on
Wellstone: too earnest, too short, too Jewish, too sincere; a real
hair shirt who's always whining about the poor and left-behind,
when the others want to talk about the Dow Jones hurdling 9,000 and
the shrimp at Barbra Streisand's house.
</P>
<P>
   But there are farm families in Iowa who'll succumb to the same
pitch he's used to woo votes in Minnesota's Iron Range. There are
voters in New Hampshire now who don't yet know his name who'll be
holding Wellstone signs a year from today.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's father, a Russian immigrant who wanted to be the
next Chekhov, was an editorial writer for The Boston Transcript who
quit over that newspaper's isolationist turn. Felix Frankfurter
helped his dad land a job in D.C. with the Voice of America. Paul,
a scrappy high school wrestler, went to the University of North
Carolina, wrestling at 126 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another Minnesota wrestler-turned-populist-pol, Governor-elect
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, ran into Wellstone at a recent match of
the University of Minnesota. ``I told Jesse `This is the real
thing,' '' grinned Wellstone on a recent Boston visit with his
wife, Sheila, a child development specialist. Ventura's victory was
a ``stick-it-to-the-establishment'' development, he said, where
same-day voter registration helped ``The Body.'' The Internet
played a key role in Ventura's astonishing victory last month, and
Wellstone's campaign manager, Dan Lucas, says that shortly you will
be able to make a secure credit-card donation to the Wellstone
cause over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone prospects via direct mail for contributions averaging
$46 a hit; right now half the money he raises (almost $600,000 to
date) goes back into direct mail. His pitch is simple: ``People who
work hard shouldn't be poor.'' He's convinced his
from-the-ground-up politics sells; ``I was the only senator up for
reelection who voted against the welfare bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll remind some of Jerry Brown, Jesse Jackson or Pat Buchanan
in railing against big business, corporate mergers, monopolies. We
don't yet know if the fund-raising scandal will move voters. Al
Gore will be the Democrats' money magnet _ and magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone: ``I want to get the big money out and the people back
in.'' Few Democrats recall now that in 1972, when former vice
presidential candidate Edmund Muskie of Maine was the prohibitive
Democratic favorite to tackle President Nixon, McGovern used the
money issue to lick Muskie.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's big issue was Vietnam, but Muskie initially refused
to disclose names of wealthy contributors who had given him secret
contributions, which were then legal. Muskie claimed, justifiably,
that Nixon's henchmen were wreaking revenge on Democratic
contributors. But McGovern's attack helped fuel the surge that
brought McGovern within 12 percent of the wobbly frontrunner in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If the stink over the Clinton-Gore fund-raising escapades
catches on as an issue, Wellstone might have a McGovern-style
opening. But Gore's image as Mr. Green/Mr. Clean may withstand his
rivals' bids to remind voters of Buddhist nuns bearing thousand
dollar gifts, and overnights for the well-heeled in the Lincoln
Bedroom. Wellstone claims he can ``ju-jitsu big money when it comes
at me.'' The old 126-pound college rassler will have the chance to
prove that.
