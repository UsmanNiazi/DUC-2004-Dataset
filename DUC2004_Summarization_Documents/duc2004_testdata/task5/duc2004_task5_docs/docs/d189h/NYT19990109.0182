MINNESOTA SENATOR NOT SEEKING WHITE HOUSE AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota announced Saturday
that he would not seek the presidency in 2000, further shrinking
the field of Democratic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wellstone had been considered a long shot, and he
viewed his candidacy as a low-budget crusade to press for liberal,
populist causes, he drew enthusiastic responses from audiences in
Iowa and other battleground states. At the very least he would have
been an irritant to the two more established candidates who are
preparing to run, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who in April was the first Democrat to set up an
exploratory committee and who has been traveling the country
seeking support since early 1997, said he had intended to run but
changed his mind because of severe back problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he recently ruptured a disc in his lower back and
that it had become too painful for him to follow a grueling travel
schedule as a presidential candidate and serve in the Senate. He
would face re-election to a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not maintain the blistering pace of national travel,
meetings, speaking and organizing that a presidential campaign
requires for almost two years,'' Wellstone, who is 54, said in
remarks at the state Capitol in St. Paul on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he has had a long history of ``painful but
manageable back troubles'' since his days as a college wrestler but
that they were aggravated by the ruptured disc.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Saturday, Wellstone said he would not
endorse another candidate now, but he expressed enthusiasm for
Bradley and also said he would welcome an entry into the contest by
Jesse Jackson. Wellstone ran Jackson's presidential campaign in
Minnesota in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jesse Jackson gets into the race, he'll make a tremendous
contribution,'' Wellstone said. ``And I've spent a tremendous
amount of time talking to Bill Bradley, who I'm sure will have much
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's announcement follows one by Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, who said he too would not seek the nomination. And
advisers to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader,
said it was increasingly unlikely that he would run, now that the
Democrats stand an improved chance of winning back the House in
2000 and he would be a leading candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said that he believed Gore was vulnerable and that he
was ``feeling glum'' about his decision but saw no alternative.
``I'm pretty disappointed about this,'' he said. ``I wanted to do
it.''
