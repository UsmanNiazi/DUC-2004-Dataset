<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate opened the politically charged  
education debate Wednesday, taking up legislation to expand to all 
50 states a pilot program that gives them greater discretion over 
how to spend federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Flexibility Partnership Act enjoys bipartisan  
support in the Senate, among the nation's governors and from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But support for the measure is not unanimous.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat, opposes the  
bill because he says there is no research to prove that a five-year 
demonstration project underway in a dozen states has improved 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a November 1998 report by the General Accounting Office,  
which audits federal programs, found inconclusive results so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone also said poor and minority pupils could suffer under  
an expanded program because states and school districts could get 
around accountability provisions in the federal law that directs 
education funds to those children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This piece of legislation doesn't lead to any additional  
opportunity for low-income children,'' argued Wellstone, noting 
that the measure would not increase funding to pay for other needs 
-- including more teachers and early education, nutrition and school 
repair programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., whose state is one of 12 participating  
in the pilot, rejected arguments that the program hurts children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no examples of abuse ... not one,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wyden, a co-sponsor of the bill with Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,  
cited a Maryland school that was able to cut its class sizes from 
25 pupils to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Ed-Flex'' program also gave low-income Oregon high school  
students opportunities to take college-level computer courses, he 
said. They had been limited to enrolling in the courses offered by 
their high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased flexibility ``doesn't serve fewer poor kids,'' Wyden  
said. ``It serves more of them and it serves them better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even the bill's sponsors acknowledged that the proposal was  
a small, first step toward addressing a host of issues plaguing 
public education -- a top agenda item for both political parties, 
each jockeying to take the lead on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is no silver bullet,'' Frist said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ed-Flex program began in 1994 as a pilot effort in six  
states. It doubled in 1996 to 12 states -- Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, 
Oregon, Texas and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for increased accountability, the program gives  
local school districts greater control over how federal education 
funds can be spent on locally designed school improvement 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the bill's fate in the Senate was unclear. A similar  
version cleared a Senate committee last summer, but the full Senate 
didn't consider it in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate over the measure could extend into next week with  
Democrats offering amendments to strengthen the bill's 
accountability provisions. Another possible amendment -- one 
expected to draw Republican opposition -- would authorize the 
remainder of Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce 
class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Clinton would veto the bill if it doesn't include  
the provision, White House spokesman Barry Toiv declined to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Education and Workforce Committee voted  
33-9 -- with support from 10 of 22 Democrats -- to send a companion 
education bill to the full House. A vote could come as early as 
next week, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is S. 280; the House version is H.R 800.
