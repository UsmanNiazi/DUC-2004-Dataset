   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is expected to vote today (WED) to
approve a nuclear-waste agreement among Texas, Maine and Vermont
despite last-minute lobbying against the pact by about 15 Texans,
including several from the West Texas area where the waste may be
stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're going to have some strong opposition (to the
waste agreement), but it's an uphill fight,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., the lead opponent in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday on the Capitol grounds, where he
was surrounded by Texans holding posters protesting the waste
agreement, Wellstone said their fight has been hampered by a lack
of support from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he has heard ``precious little'' from an
administration that ``says it's focused on environmental justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the president's and vice president's support,''
Wellstone said. ``We need for them to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton overseas and no formal statement of administration
policy drawn up as of Tuesday, it was unlikely that Wellstone would
receive reinforcements in time for today's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote is the last legislative action needed to seal an
agreement, known as a compact, that will allow Maine and Vermont to
ship low-level radioactive waste _ including pieces of dismantled
nuclear power plants _ to Texas for long-term storage. The House
has already approved the compact, which does not specify a site for
storing the waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature has approved a site near Sierra Blanca in
Hudspeth County for the waste dump, but that plan became less
certain in early July when state examiners recommended that the
site be rejected because of concerns that the area's geology and
the economic impact of the dump hadn't been adequately addressed.
Those two issues drove Tuesday's protest and lobbying effort in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The geological study should include a look at what leakage from
the waste site might do to underground water supplies and the Rio
Grande, said State Rep. Norma Chavez, D-El Paso, and Sierra Blanca
resident Bill Addington _ two of the Texans who met Senate staffers
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a hanging offense to poison a man's well in
Texas,'' Addington said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact on Sierra Blanca, a mostly Hispanic
community about 90 miles southeast of El Paso, is what has stirred
Wellstone's passion against the compact: ``This isn't just a Texas
issue. This is a national civil rights issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's work against the waste agreement earned him honorary
Austin citizenship last October from the Austin City Council and
gratitude Tuesday from state Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fair to dump on us (in Texas), and I thank Sen.
Wellstone for serving as my senator,'' Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' two senators, Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, support the compact. Both have said they're following
the wishes of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former Gov. Ann Richards
and the Texas Legislature. In a statement Tuesday, Hutchison also
noted that the compact has been approved by governors and state
lawmakers in Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the federal government has a mandate to
nullify a contract signed by three state governors and ratified by
their legislatures,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency in charge of developing the waste site, the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, has taken
issue with the examiners' report in a formal response, according to
Geoff Connor, general counsel of the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, which must approve the site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the site have a Friday deadline for filing their
response to the authority's comments, Connor said. The examiners
will then be allowed to revise their assessment before their report
goes to the full commission.
</P>
<P>
   Connor said he could offer no time frame for when the commission
might take up the matter of placing the dump.
