<HEADLINE> Diana Saw JFK Jr. As Role Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Princess Diana saw John F. Kennedy Jr. as a role  
model for her son, Prince William, especially in handling of the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping he'll grow up to be as smart about it as John  
Kennedy Jr.,'' she said two months before her death in a 1997 Paris 
traffic crash. William is second in line for the throne of England, 
behind his father, Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want William to be able to handle things as well as John  
does,'' The New Yorker magazine quoted her as saying in an article 
published after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Kennedy's airplane was missing on a flight from New  
Jersey to Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. Also on the plane were 
Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren 
Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention that had been focused on him and his  
sister, Caroline, Kennedy responded then that he believed he had it 
easier growing up in the public eye than William and his brother, 
Prince Harry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really able to lead a normal life from about the age of  
5. I went to boarding school and then college,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing I went through could compare to what they are  
facing,'' Kennedy told reporters about two weeks after Diana's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had taught  
him about handling fame, Kennedy said: ``We didn't actually sit 
down and have a tutorial session. But you pick things up.''
