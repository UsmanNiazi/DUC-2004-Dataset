 &HT;    Like his famous father, he represented hope for the future

<P>
   Why do people care so much that John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a
plane crash last Friday?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is pretty simple. It's because of what he stood for
and the kind of guy he was. Like his father before him, he
symbolized hope for the future and the idea that anything is
possible if you're young and try hard, says Gerald Celente, a New
York social scientist.
</P>
<P>
   It was John Jr.'s dad, President John F. Kennedy, who said in
the early 1960s that we'd land a man on the moon before 1970. The
goal was accomplished in 1969. And it was President Kennedy who
faced down the Russians in 1962 when the world was on the brink of
nuclear war. He was also one of the first major white leaders to
push for equal rights for African-Americans, which eventually led
to the Civil Rights Act in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering John's dad
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy's Jr.'s memorial service is today. His death
makes adults remember the first JFK, who many people think was one
of our nation's greatest presidents. President Kennedy was a hero
in World War II, and seemed to have everything. Tons of money.
Movie-star good looks. A gorgeous wife. And power.
</P>
<P>
   But then he was assassinated in 1963. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   When he died, the whole world cried. For many, the hope he
represented was snuffed out. We soon got more involved in the
Vietnam War, and race riots marred many American cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a famous
African-American leader, was murdered. And a few months later,
President Kennedy's brother Robert was shot dead, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy clan
</P>
<P>
   Many say the Kennedy clan is the closest thing America has ever
had to a royal family. John Kennedy Jr.'s great-great grandparents
moved to America from Ireland in the 1850s. His granddad, Joe,
started off selling candy and newspapers, and got rich by the time
he was 35. Joe and his wife, Rose, built their fortune as they
built their family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Joe was named U.S. ambassador to England, and in 1939,
he warned that war was coming. He was right. He'd hoped his son Joe
Jr. would become president one day, but Joe Jr. died in a World War
II plane crash. So Joe Sr. turned to his John.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr.'s dad was almost killed in World War II, too. When he
got home, he was elected to Congress. He won the presidency in
1960, thanks in part to his glamorous wife, Jackie. John Jr.,
called John-John by the media, was born in November 1960, just
weeks before his father took office in 1961, and was a celebrity
from the second he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Living a normal life
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. and his older sister, Caroline, grew up with the world
watching. By the time he was a young boy, John Jr. was used to the
spotlight. But he never became a snob, says Peggy Barlett, an
expert on culture at Emory University. In fact, he led a pretty
ordinary life, and took up hobbies like regular folks do _ such as
inline skating, sailing and learning to fly.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. went to college at Brown University in Rhode Island and
then went to law school at New York University. He worked as a
prosecutor in New York City. But he left that work to start a
magazine called George. He also was known for doing charity work
and contributing money to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   He married his sweetheart, Carolyn Bessette, in 1996 on
Georgia's Cumberland Island. Carolyn Bessette and her sister Lauren
were also killed in the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think JFK Jr. represented dignity and grace ... in a way
that's rare with celebrities,'' says Barlett. ``He was wealthy and
famous, but he wanted to serve, to contribute his life to the
betterment of the nation, and we admired him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also admired, says Celente, because he wasn't a phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the subway. He always had this nice calming smile on
his face. It wasn't because he was so handsome that he was loved,
but a guy who related to the common man, the little people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, he was a lot like Princess Di. He didn't have to
mingle with the little people, but he did. And Americans are hungry
for someone like he was who's not a hypocrite who's in a place of
power to influence positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   With JFK Jr.'s death, Celente says, the Kennedy family has lost
its brightest beacon of hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family has known sad times
</P>
<P>
   Curses are only real in horror movies, but the Kennedy family
has had horribly bad luck. John Kennedy Sr.'s dad, Joe, was the
grandson of poor people who moved to America from Ireland. Joe
started with zilch, married a woman named Rose and worked hard. But
it wasn't long before tragedy began to stalk.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s granddad, had hoped his son Joe Jr. would
become president, but Joe Jr. was killed in World War II. Daughter
Kathleen died in a plane crash, too, in 1948. President John
Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Sen. Robert Kennedy was shot dead
during the 1968 presidential campaign. Ted Kennedy, who's in the
Senate, nearly died in a plane crash in the early 1960s, and in
1969 he drove a car off a bridge. A woman who was riding with him
died.
</P>
<P>
   And Joe's grandkids have had a lot of bad luck, too. One was
killed almost two years ago when he plowed into a tree while
skiing. Another died of a drug overdose. Others have been involved
in scandals. Now JFK Jr. and his wife are dead.
