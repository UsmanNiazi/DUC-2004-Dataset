	LONDON (AP) -- Even where they hardly knew the man, they were  
mystified by ``the curse,'' as people around the world heard the 
news of the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tragedy in the United States' most famous political  
clan dominated headlines Sunday in world papers, many of which ran 
the famed 1963 photo of ``John-John'' saluting the coffin of his 
slain father, President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inexplicable curse of the Kennedys,'' London's The Sunday  
Telegraph said in a headline for a story that ran over three pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tragedy without end: John F. Kennedy Jr. Crashes,'' ran the  
headline in the Sunday edition of Frankfurter Allgemeine. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr. was traveling with his wife, Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a family 
wedding when their plane disappeared over the ocean on its way to 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ireland, the home of Kennedy ancestors, state TV and radio  
channel, RTE, sent its Washington correspondent to Massachusetts to 
cover what it described as a tragedy for ``the Irish-American 
political dynasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance became the main lead item in most of  
Ireland's Sunday newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. is not well known in all European countries, but most  
know the fabled Kennedy name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad how despite all the fame and riches, that one  
family can be followed by so much bad luck,'' said Giesela Braun, a 
resident of Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Firman, 49, a London nurse, said she was not nearly as  
affected by the loss of Kennedy as she was by the 1997 death of 
Princess Diana in a Paris car crash. ``Mostly because I didn't know 
him as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Kennedy's disappearance led all the radio and  
television reports and headlined most of Sunday's daily newspapers, 
which included pictures of the family and ``family trees'' of 
Kennedys who died young. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Channel 2 TV station interviewed a former schoolmate of  
Kennedy when he was at private school in New York in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He insisted on being an ordinary kid. Every day we took the  
bus from 5th Avenue to the West Side and he insisted on taking the 
bus with us,'' said Daniel Diker. ``He was a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II, vacationing in the Italian Alps, said he was  
praying for the whole Kennedy clan. ``This is only the latest 
tragedy that family has suffered,'' said spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro-Valls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kennedy curse strikes again'', said the Sunday Times of  
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kennedy family again meets the vicious curse,'' opined  
Hong Kong's Chinese-language daily Oriental Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's acting prime minister, Tim Fischer, sent a message  
of sympathy to the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also expressed his ``sorrow for  
the loss of John Kennedy Jr.'' He went on to castigate U.S. 
authorities for failing so far to locate the lost plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance was the main story on the front page of  
most major Mexican newspapers. The tabloid La Cronica carried 
photos of Kennedy with his mother and father, and a front-page 
chronology of other tragedies to hit the family. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cambodians were mourning one of their own national icons,  
actress Piseth Peaklica, gunned down July 6. More than 10,000 
people packed her funeral Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians might hear about the crash, but I doubt regular  
Cambodians are interested because it is too far from them to 
care,'' said Kong Korm, a senator.
