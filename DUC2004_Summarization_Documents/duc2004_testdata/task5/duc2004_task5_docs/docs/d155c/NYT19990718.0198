   WASHINGTON _ Steps from the Rose Garden where he shook President
John F. Kennedy's hand in 1963, President Clinton made his first
public remarks Sunday on the disappearance of JFK's son,
summarizing the Kennedy family legacy as one of having ``suffered
much and given more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke after returning from Camp David, where he had been
in telephone contact with Coast Guard officials conducting the
search for John Kennedy Jr.'s plane. He spoke only briefly,
addressing the personal and public undercurrent of the event: the
image of the assassinated president, and the children who were
supposed to carry on the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 40 years now the Kennedy family has inspired
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future
and moved our nation forward,'' Clinton said. ``In recent years in
particular, John Kennedy Jr. and Caroline have captured our
imagination and won our affection . . . We hope the families of
these fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of
their friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words seemed to reflect a pall that has been cast over
Capitol Hill since early Saturday, when politicians raised in the
shadow of JFK began fearing the worst for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties reacted to news of the disappearance of
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his
sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, in solemn terms. On the Sunday
morning Fox news show, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut
said JFK Jr. ``took the words . . . that mark his father's
presidency: Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you
can do for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The torch has passed to a new generation,'' said Lieberman, a
Democrat. ``But he expressed that ideal of citizenship and public
service in a largely nonpartisan and nontraditional political
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore canceled a presidential
fundraising brunch and attended church, where, he said, he prayed
for the passengers on the missing plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, we are reminded of the sacrifices of the Kennedy
family, and how precious and fragile life is,'' Gore said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And in Massachusetts, Representative Edward J. Markey said it
was clear that the disappearance had hit far more than just
political chords. The impact was on ``not just Washington,'' he
said, but on a generation still captivated by the family legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed for him at Mass . . . this morning,'' Markey said of
John Kennedy Jr. ``Hundreds of millions of people in this country
and around the world are sad today. JFK's picture is still on the
walls of homes across the country, and JFK Jr. represents the
continuation of a commitment to inclusiveness and diversity, and
the contemporary engagement of the issues of the time.''
