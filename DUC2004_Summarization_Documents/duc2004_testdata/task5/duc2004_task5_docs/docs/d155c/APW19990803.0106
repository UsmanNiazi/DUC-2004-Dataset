	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Deep in the Jerusalem hills, trees were planted  
Tuesday in memory of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his 
sister-in-law in a forest named for his father. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Israeli tradition of honoring someone's memory by  
planting a tree, three oak saplings were placed in the rocky soil 
next to a white stone marker with the names of Kennedy, his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	The three died when Kennedy's single-engine plane crashed off  
Martha's Vineyard on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees were planted by visiting Americans and Jewish National  
Fund officials on a sloping hillside next to a memorial for 
President Kennedy, designed as a tree stump to symbolize a life cut 
down before its time. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, JFK Jr., his wife and sister-in-law were also  
remembered in a memorial Mass on Tuesday attended by the city's 
mayor, Francesco Rutelli, and U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foglietta. 
About 20 people attended the service in Santa Susanna, a Roman 
Catholic church frequented by Americans in the city.
