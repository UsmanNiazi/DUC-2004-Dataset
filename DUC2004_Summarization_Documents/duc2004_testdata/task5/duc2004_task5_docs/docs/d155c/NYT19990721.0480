   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ The bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and sister-in-law were recovered Wednesday from the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean where they had lain inside their crashed plane for
nearly five days. As the bodies were recovered, the Kennedy family
made plans for a burial at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of JFK Jr., 38, his 33-year-old wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, 35-year-old Lauren Bessette, were
placed aboard a Coast Guard cutter and brought ashore to waiting
cars from the local medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Three of JFK Jr.'s relatives were aboard the cutter when the
bodies were recovered _ Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
his two sons, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Edward
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the bodies ended five days of sorrowful vigil
for the Kennedy and Bessette families and set the stage for
ceremonies to say goodbye to their loved ones. The Kennedys will
hold a memorial Friday morning in New York City, and the Bessettes
announced a memorial service will be held Saturday in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported late Wednesday that the Kennedy family had plans to
bury JFK Jr. at sea, possibly Thursday morning in a ceremony off
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today we were able to bring closure to two families,
and I think that, we realize, is very important,'' said Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabee. ``I think it's amazing we were able to get to
this point.``
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said the three bodies were ``in or near'' an 8-10 foot
section of the Kennedy plane's fuselage, and were still strapped
in.
</P>
<P>
   The victims and the section of fuselage, which included the
plane's instrument panel, were brought to the surface about 4:30
p.m. EDT, about six hours after they were first identified by Navy
divers searching for the plane's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys had been picked up by a Coast Guard helicopter at
the family compound at Hyannis Port about 1 p.m. and taken to the
wreckage site. Ships, helicopters and airplanes in the area were
barred from coming within five miles of the recovery ship.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were to be examined by the medical examiner's office
and soon returned to their families.
</P>
<P>
   The successful recovery followed days of often frustrating
searches involving ships and personnel from the Coast Guard, Navy
and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Although
investigators believed they had promising leads on the wreckage
location as early as Monday, the recovery efforts moved relatively
slowly until late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said search ships identified ``a major piece of
wreckage'' 116 feet below the surface about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday.
Searchers then anchored a naval recovery ship above the wreckage
about 7 1/2 miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard, within sight of
the former summer home of JFK Jr.'s mother, former first lady
Jacqueline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   After several surveys by a remote-operated vehicle equipped with
cameras Wednesday morning, searchers were able to confirm they had
found the main body of the plane. At 10:30 a.m., two Navy divers
tethered to the USS Grasp descended to the wreckage for about 45
minutes and were able to locate and find the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, searchers achieved their primary goal and had the
three bodies recovered from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said the bodies were brought to the surface ``in a way
that I think respected the situation we were in. It was something
we were very sensitive about.``
</P>
<P>
   Officials said efforts to recover other pieces of the plane,
which shattered on impact with the water after a 30-second
freefall, will continue for several days.
</P>
<P>
   According to radar data turned over to the National
Transportation Safety Board, the flight's last minute was a
harrowing experience.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. and his passengers took off at 8:38 p.m. Friday from the
Essex County airport in Fairfield, N.J. The three were en route to
the Martha's Vineyard airport, where the Kennedys planned to drop
off Bessette and continue on to Hyannis Port, where the couple was
to attend Saturday's wedding of JFK Jr.'s cousin _ 30-year-old Rory
Kennedy, the youngest child of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, radar information showed the plane traveling at
5,600 feet, just 34 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport. The
plane then began descending at about 700 feet per second, a descent
rate experts say is about typical. After about five minutes, the
plane was within 20 miles of the airport at 2,300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the plane's actions become more puzzling. NTSB
officials said JFK Jr.'s plane turned to the right, off course from
the airport and climbed to 2,600 feet. After one minute, the plane
turned to the right again and began plummeting toward the ocean at
more than 5,000 feet per minute, a rate experts have described as a
freefall or ``death spiral.'' About 30 seconds later, the plane
crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, state and federal agencies launched a
massive search effort, giving up hope of finding survivors Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the bodies of the victims recovered Wednesday,
attention turned almost immediately to memorial services and
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family sources said Wednesday night that Sen. Kennedy
had requested and obtained permission from the Navy to have his
nephew buried at sea, and the naval destroyer USS Briscoe was
reported en route to Cape Cod. It was not known whether the sea
burial plans included JFK Jr.'s wife.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for several memorial services were firmed up Wednesday
afternoon, however. The first service was planned by the Emerald
Isle Immigration Society, an Irish group in New York City. That
service was scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday at old St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy and Bessette families also planned private services
for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   A service for JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy will be held
at 11 a.m. Friday at the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan.
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have said
they will attend.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for Lauren Bessette will take place at 7 p.m.
Saturday at the Christ Church in the Bessette's hometown of
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences for the Kennedy family can be sent to Sen. Kennedy's
office at 315 Russell Senate Building, Washington, D.C., 20510.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton defended the search and recovery efforts at a
news conference Wednesday, saying the efforts were ``consistent
with what would have been done in any other case.'' Clinton said
the effort was warranted because of the Kennedy family's ``role in
our national lives, and because of the enormous losses that they
have sustained in our lifetimes.``
