<HEADLINE> `George' Cover Marks JFK Jr. Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest George magazine -- a tribute to  
founder John F. Kennedy Jr. -- is without a celebrity cover for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The October issue, which comes two months after Kennedy's death,  
has a blurry image of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue contains several interviews Kennedy did, including  
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrahkan, Fidel Castro and President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine quotes Kennedy as saying: ``In the most challenging  
of times, men and women of courage and conviction make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law  
Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane he was piloting crashed 
off the shore of Martha's Vineyard.
