   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest congressional
critics of the United Nations, offered ``my hand of friendship'' today to the
world body but coupled his overture with sharp warning that the organization not
overstep its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A United Nations that seeks to impose its presumed authority on the
American people without their consent begs for confrontation, and I want to be
candid, eventual U.S. withdrawal,'' Helms said in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused the
188-member U.N. General Assembly of an anti-American bias in many of its
activities and said that Americans ``have grown increasingly frustrated with
what they feel is a lack of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Helms, R-N.C., said he hoped that relations would improve between the
world body and the Republican-led U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intent to offend you, and I hope I will not,'' Helms said.
``It is my intent to extend to you my hand of friendship and convey the hope
that in the days to come ... we can join in a mutual respect.''
