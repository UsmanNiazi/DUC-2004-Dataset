<HEADLINE> Helms Has Congresswomen Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several congresswomen were removed from a  
Senate hearing today on orders of Sen. Jesse Helms after they tried 
to present him a letter supporting an international treaty against 
sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, has blocked a Senate vote on the 1979 United Nations 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., led the congresswomen and several  
female staff members to Helms' office and then to the Foreign 
Relations Committee, where he was chairing a hearing on China. They 
tried to present him a letter signed by more than 100 House members 
in support of the U.N. Convention to eliminate All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
	After asking the women to ``please act like ladies,'' Helms  
directed Capitol Police to escort them from the hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women of the House will no longer tolerate his delay  
tactics,'' Woolsey said. She said Democratic representatives had 
attempted to meet with Helms for nearly five years on the treaty, 
but had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not know what the senator's objections to the treaty  
could possibly be, because he hasn't told us,'' said Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' staffers had no comment after the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	Helms, a critic of the United Nations, has often opposed U.S.  
participation in international treaties. He recently led Senate 
efforts to defeat ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey said 162 nations had ratified the women's treaty since  
the U.N. General Assembly approved it 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton submitted the U.N. convention on women's  
rights to the Senate in 1994. Helms has not scheduled hearings on 
the issue, or submitted the treaty to the full Senate for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed  
ratification of the treaty with Helms. ``It's not his favorite 
treaty, but I have made clear it is an administration priority,'' 
Albright said.
