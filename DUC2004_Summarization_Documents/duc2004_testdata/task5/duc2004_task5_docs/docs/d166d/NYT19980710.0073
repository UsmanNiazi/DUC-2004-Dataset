DEAR JESSE 
Documentary written and directed by: Tim Kirkman 
Running time: 81 minutes 
Rated: Unrated

<P>
   Jesse Helms _ and William Weld will bear me out on this _ is
against a lot of things. Tim Kirkman's autobiographgical memoir,
``Dear Jesse,'' reminds us that the Republican senator is against
abortion rights and federal funding for the arts, among other
things. While Helms would not vote against tobacco, he almost
certainly would turn thumbs down on Kirkman's gentle documentary,
which juxtaposes Kirkman's own personal history as a gay man
growing up in Monroe, N.C., with a scrapbook chronicling Helms's
rise as a conservative politician there following stints as a
newspaper columnist and TV commentator that made him, if not rich,
media-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   When Helms spoke out against the staging of the gay-themed
Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Angels in America'' in Charlotte, N.C., he
said, ``I didn't see any point in a naked man cavorting around the
stage.'' No naked man cavorts around the stage in Tony Kushner's
play, a point obscured in what passes for aesthetic debate in
Helms's circle. But the useful thing about ``Dear Jesse'' is that
it snaps the viewer out of any feeling of intellectual smugness and
back to stark reality with interviews in Helms's home state that
leave no doubt about Helms's vast popularity there.
</P>
<P>
   More than one voter says that he or she doesn't like Helms's
history, but that at least they know where they stand with Helms
and believe he'll keep his word. Leaving aside that the same could
have been said of Hitler or Stalin or Mao, it sheds some light on
the reason Helms gets voted in year after year, anachronism that he
is, with his appeals to ignorance. Without ever resorting to
stridency, Kirkman, who long ago moved to Helms's version of Sodom
and Gomorrah _ New York _ shows Helms shrewdly manipulating
attention away from his tobacco-based financing.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's technique is simple but, so far, effective. Helms
divisively scapegoats the arts and minorities ranging from
African-Americans to gays and lesbians, while righteously
proclaiming in passing that people who die of AIDS deserve what
they get. Kirkman's personal diary, with its homegrown flavor, is
on the soft side, but the link between Kirkman's departure for a
more tolerant environment and the kind of thinking Helms embodies
is made trenchantly clear. ``Dear Jesse'' doesn't raise its voice
to make its points. With Helms doing most of the talking, it
doesn't have to.
