<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Jesse Helms Proposes Aid for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Jesse Helms,
co-author of the anti-Cuba Helms-Burton Law, proposed Thursday a
100 million U.S. dollar humanitarian aid package of food and
medicine for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under Helms' proposal, supported by both Democratic and
Republican lawmakers, the four-year aid will be channeled through
nongovernmental organizations in Cuba such as the Roman Catholic
church and independent relief groups like Caritas.
</P>
<P>
The bill also proposed that President Bill Clinton would have
to increase efforts to support democracy in Cuba, including
starting radio and television broadcasts from the U.S. military
base at Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts by Radio and TV Marti from Miami designed to
oppose the Cuban government were jammed by the Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
Helms and House Representative Dan Burton initiated the most
controversial Helms-Burton bill which was enacted as law in 1996.
The law, which punishes a third country doing business in Cuba,
was strongly condemned worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation, Helms said, would not loosen the U.S.
economic embargo on Cuba but would change U.S. policy by moving
from isolation of the Cuban government to active support of those
trying to change Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Clinton administration decided to ease some
sanctions against Cuba, allowing direct flights and letting
U.S.-based family members send up to 1,200 U.S. dollars a year to
relatives in Cuba.
