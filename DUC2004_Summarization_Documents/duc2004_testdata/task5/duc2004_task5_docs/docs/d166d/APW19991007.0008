<HEADLINE> Helms Leads Test Ban Treaty Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the straightest of faces, Sen. Jesse  
Helms intoned: ``This is the final hearing by the Foreign Relations 
Committee on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What North Carolina Republican didn't mention Thursday was that  
it was also the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Feared by many Democrats but praised by conservatives, Helms has  
long been a thorn in the side of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is a leading opponent of President Clinton's effort to  
win ratification of the global pact to ban all nuclear test 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any possibility of this treaty  
passing,'' he says with a beam of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Helms, 79, has thrown up obstacles for  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he single-handedly scuttled the nomination of former  
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be 
ambassador to Mexico. He simply refused to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	If that helped cement his nickname ``Senator No,'' so be it,  
Helms told an audience of conservatives earlier this year. ``Saying 
no is part of the job. ... And I plan to say `no' to a few more 
things this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also contributed to making life difficult for diplomat  
Richard Holbrooke, whose Senate confirmation as U.N. ambassador 
took more than a year. That delay was exacerbated by the 
administration itself in a prolonged ethics investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms eventually supported Holbrooke -- but only after extracting  
a pledge from him to press for ``reforms'' at the United Nations, 
including lower U.S. payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also has served notice on the administration that he  
believes the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Treaty belongs in ``the 
dustbin of history'' and should be reviewed by the Senate and 
nullified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jesse Helms has never seen a treaty or an agreement that he's  
ever liked,'' said Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to 
Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an advocacy group supporting the test-ban 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has used his near-dictatorial authority to its fullest  
extent in blocking the Senate from considering this treaty for two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A vote is set for Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Knowing support for the treaty among Republicans was nearly  
nonexistent, Helms and Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
abruptly decided to call the bluff of Democrats who were protesting 
the lack of Senate movement on the pact -- submitted back in 
September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House and Democrats signaled they wanted more  
time to rally support, Helms threatened to block any such delay -- 
unless Clinton requested it in writing and promised not to press 
for action ``for the duration of his presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Clinton declined.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a reporter why he was making such a severe demand on  
the president when he could easily block the treaty from coming up 
again as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Helms 
reflected a moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could do that,'' he said finally. ``But that would not be  
strong enough to suit me. I want his signature on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the committee's senior Democrat,  
called Helms' demand ``preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Biden, who would be chairman of the committee if Democrats  
regained the Senate, enjoys warm relations with Helms despite their 
repeated policy clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you, but I find your characterizations interesting,''  
Biden told Helms at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also enjoys friendly relations with Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright -- who went out of her way to court him from her 
first days on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello Madeleine,'' he said warmly as he shook her hand on  
Thursday as she prepared to testify, even though the two are locked 
on opposite sides of the test-ban issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms chuckles when he notes that it's the Clinton  
administration and Senate Democrats who now want a delay on the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was perfectly willing to keep the treaty in the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee and I did a pretty good job at it for a 
while,'' he said.
