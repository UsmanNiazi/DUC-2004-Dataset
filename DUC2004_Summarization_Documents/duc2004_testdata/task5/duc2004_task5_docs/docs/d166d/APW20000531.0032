<HEADLINE> Helms Recalls Another N.C. Naysayer  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When he exercises his authority to say no,
Sen. Jesse Helms is taking his cues from a fellow North Carolinian
who exasperated presidents and other politicians two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., unveiled a portrait in the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee room this month of Nathaniel Macon, who in the
1820s chaired the committee that Helms now heads with the same
parsimony, piety and deep suspicion of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Helms recalled visiting Macon's gravestone, inscribed with a
tribute from Thomas Jefferson, whom Macon both befriended and
beleaguered. He referred to a 1998 policy speech in which he
praised Macon as ''a fierce opponent of any and all measures to
expand the power of the new federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He believed what I do,'' Helms said. ''Saying no is a part of
the job of being the Foreign Relations Committee chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to the Senate 28 years ago, Helms has
infuriated leaders of both parties with his fierce opposition to
treaties, his disdain for the United Nations and foreign aid and
his unbending conservative positions on issues such as abortion,
homosexual rights and federal funding for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, 78, is determined to terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. He led the drive last year to defeat the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He has made clear that any late-term
agreements worked out by President Clinton and new Russian
President Vladimir Putin will be dead on arrival in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Faulkner, a history professor at Campbell University in
Buies Creek, N.C., said at the portrait ceremony that Macon ''is in
a very real sense the spiritual predecessor'' of Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner has written a book published by the Jesse Helms Center
in Wingate, N.C., comparing Macon and Helms. He says the
similarities are striking: their rural North Carolina roots, devout
Baptist beliefs, public and private frugality, distrust of the
federal government, dedication to state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Macon was House speaker before moving to the Senate in 1815,
where he worked to defeat legislation the following year to
increase a lawmaker's pay from $6 a day to $1,500 a year, said
Richard Baker, the Senate's historian. The salary remained
unchanged for the next 40 years, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Macon's opposition was most steadfast when it came to imposing
taxes and spending money. He voted for the declaration of war
against England in 1812 but opposed conscription and all taxes
needed to wage war. He voted against money for roads and canals and
opposed rechartering the First Bank of the United States, a
precursor of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In 1815 he opposed the purchase of his friend Jefferson's
library, which became the foundation of the Library of Congress,
and in 1824 unsuccessfully tried to block the granting of $200,000
to Revolutionary War ally the Marquis de Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner quoted a fellow historian who described Macon's
political career as ''defeating what he could, obstructing by
parliamentary maneuver what he could not defeat and amending into
uselessness what he could not otherwise obstruct.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 37 years in Congress, ''Macon cast more no votes than
did any 10 other members combined,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated John Quincy Adams reportedly described Macon as
''covered by an encrustation of prejudices which experience cannot
remove.''
</P>
<P>
   But Macon, like Helms, also was genuinely liked by his
colleagues for his honesty, lack of airs and the strength of his
convictions. ''Nothing sordid ever entered into his imagination,''
President John Tyler said of Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, for his part, gets along well with his Democratic
opposite on the Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden of Delaware,
and has maintained warm relations with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. She once presented Helms with a T-shirt reading:
''Someone at the State Department loves me.''
