   BOSTON _ A career diplomat long affiliated with the Democratic
Party blasted the Clinton administration Wednesday for attempting
to appease Senator Jesse Helms and other congressional
conservatives, saying the executive branch has traded away its
leadership in foreign policy and gotten nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, who resigned as director of the US Agency for
International Development last year after it became clear Helms had
blocked his nomination to be ambassador to Brazil, said the
administration ``should have known better'' than to attempt to
appease the North Carolina archconservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Senator Helms a great deal,'' Atwood said in a
speech to the United Nations Association of Greater Boston and the
Boston Committee on Foreign Relations. ``He is a man of his word.
His position has been known for years and he has never changed that
position. He is opposed to the United Nations. He is opposed to
international engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood works on international development issues for Joseph P.
Kennedy 2d's Citizens Energy Corp. He declined to fault
administration officials by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're taking the Security Council down to
Washington to meet (Helms),'' Atwood said. ``All that's going to do
is empower him. It's going to encourage his colleagues to say `We
can't get into this, Jesse's handling it.' Baloney!''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said reducing US contributions to the United Nations may
be worth considering, but the way the United States is attempting
to do this is ill-advised and will harm the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is attemopting to accomplish this goal by
placing a legislatively imposed gun to the head of the General
Assembly,'' Atwood said. ``This is not a constructive way to
engage. This is not cooperation. This is an undisguised attempt to
blackmail. . . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we achieve in winning by blackmail?'' he asked. ``We
merely encourage others to use our methods. Do we want the
parliaments of Germany and Japan to hold back their UN payments
until those countries are made permanent members of the Security
Council?''
