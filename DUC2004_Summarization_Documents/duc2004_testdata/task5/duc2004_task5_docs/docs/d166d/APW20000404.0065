<HEADLINE> Jesse Helms Has Neurological Disease  </HEADLINE>

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms says a neurological
disease has forced him to use a cane but is not causing him serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, 78, has been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and
received treatment last fall at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The disease affects the nerves that run from the brain or the
spine to the arms, hands, legs and feet by breaking down the sheath
that covers and protects nerve endings. The exposed nerves become
inflamed, interrupting their ability to conduct brain signals to
the extremities.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has multiple causes and no certain permanent cure.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a numbness or a no-feeling situation in an
extremity,'' the North Carolina Republican told The News &AMP; Observer
of Raleigh in an interview last week. ''I happen to have it in my
feet. But it doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the numbness causes difficulty with balance and forces
him to use a cane, Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms underwent eight treatments using an experimental therapy
called intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. The therapy, overseen
by the National Institutes of Health, replaces antibodies whose
absence is thought to cause the deterioration of the nerve
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' doctors don't know the cause of the condition and his
physician wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said he has recovered from earlier double knee-replacement
surgery and feels no knee pain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Helms also has undergone surgery for
prostate cancer and a quadruple heart bypass. He has suffered from
Paget's disease, a degenerative bone disorder, in his hip.
