<HEADLINE> Helms Refuses to Consider Weld Nomination as Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms today refused to put the
nomination of William Weld as U.S. ambassador to Mexico on the
agenda of a special committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senator Richard Lugar and three others who
requested the meeting, Helms said he alone has authority to set
the agenda of the meeting of the Committee scheduled on September
12.
</P>
<P>
"The Weld nomination will not be on the agenda of this
meeting," Helms said.
</P>
<P>
Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, was nominated by
President Bill Clinton in July to be ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Helms, who accused Weld of being too lenient on illegal drugs,
insisted that he will not consider Weld as a candidate for the
post.
</P>
<P>
But Weld denies he is soft on drugs and has demanded a public
hearing on his record.
</P>
<P>
Lugar and other members of the 15-member Foreign Relations
Committee uphold that Helms should not be permitted to block a
confirmation hearing for Weld.
</P>
<P>
An approval of the nomination by the Committee is needed before
the nomination goes to the full Senate for a vote.
