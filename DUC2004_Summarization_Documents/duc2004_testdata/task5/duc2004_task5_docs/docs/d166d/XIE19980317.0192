<HEADLINE> Cuba Accepts no Pretended Humanitarian Aid From US: Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is set to refuse United
States aid offers backed by a senator responsible for tightening
the economic blockade against Havana.
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities accused Senator Jesse Helms of violating his
own Helms-Burton Act, which imposed further restrictions on
foreign investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper Trabajadores criticised Helms in an
editorial after the senator interceded to allow U.S. federal funds
to be used to send food and medical aid to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban people will under no circumstances accept the
proposal of Senator Helms to send pretend humanitarian aid to the
island," said the official publication of Cuba's Central Trade
Union.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was seeking to give its economic blockade
an "altruistic mask which is a pantomime that nobody takes
seriously", the editorial claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, which was signed into law by President
Bill Clinton in March, 1996, took the U.S. blockade to "the
highest summit of political absurdity".
</P>
<P>
Any solution to the Helms-Burton Act would have to respect the
dignity, independence and sovereignty of Cuba, the editorial
said.
