<HEADLINE> Helms Invites U.N. Officials To D.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, is inviting U.N. Security Council members to
visit the Senate on March 30, making good on an invitation he
extended when he spoke to the world body in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be our pleasure to repay your hospitality and to
continue the important dialogue we began together in New York,''
said Helms, R-N.C., and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the
committee's senior Democrat, in letters to council members.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many of the council's 15 members would take
up Helms and Biden's offer. But on the Security Council's informal
calendar for the month, the words ''Washington trip'' and a
question mark are penciled in.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' Jan. 21 address was the first ever by a U.S. lawmaker to
the council. Although cordial in tone and calling for ''a new
beginning,'' Helms laced his remarks with sharp criticism of the
international organization. Delegates reacted coolly to the list of
alleged U.N. shortcomings and failures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the invitation, the visit would include a tour of
the Capitol, a discussion of the history of the Senate, a luncheon
and ''roundtable discussions on U.N. reform and peacekeeping'' in
the committee's hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and Biden wrote to the current council president, Anwarul
Karim Chowdhury of Bangladesh, and other members of the council.
The council has five permanent members -- the United States, Russia,
Britain, France and China -- and 10 elected by the General Assembly
for two-year terms.
