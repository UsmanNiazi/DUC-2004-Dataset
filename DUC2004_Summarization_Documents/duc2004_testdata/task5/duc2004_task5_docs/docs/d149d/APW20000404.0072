<HEADLINE> Freeh Denies Job-Hunting Reports  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior FBI official denied a published
report that FBI Director Louis Freeh is job-hunting and expects to
leave office before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't decided when he's leaving,'' the senior official
said of the 51-year-old FBI chief whose tenured term runs through
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some time he said he wouldn't leave any sooner than the
end of the year, and everyone here expects him to stay longer than
that,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   This official, who spoke Monday night on condition of anonymity,
said Freeh has made commitments to give speeches and make
appearances as FBI director through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Freeh does not want a change in the FBI
directorship to be linked to a change in U.S. presidential
administrations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who appointed Freeh, but whose relations with
the bureau chief have soured, leaves office early next year. The
tenured term was designed by Congress to make the FBI director
independent of any one White House administration. Freeh does not
want to undermine that, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that
intermediaries for Freeh have been sounding out legal and financial
services firms here and elsewhere on his behalf, telling them Freeh
is expected to leave office in the last several months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior official said, ''Freeh has not approached any
companies seeking employment nor has he authorized any others to do
so on his behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   This official said Freeh reiterated that to him on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years as a public servant -- FBI agent, federal
prosecutor, federal judge and FBI director -- Freeh faces some
financial difficulty in paying college tuition for his six boys.
</P>
<P>
   As FBI director, Freeh makes $141,300 annually. The senior
official said Freeh has declined more than one offer of a legal job
paying more than $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official said he understood ''one of Freeh's friends
trying to look out for him'' was making unauthorized inquiries
about whether companies would be interested in hiring Freeh.
