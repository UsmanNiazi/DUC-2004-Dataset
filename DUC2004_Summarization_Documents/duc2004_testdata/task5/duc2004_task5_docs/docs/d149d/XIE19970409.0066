<HEADLINE> FBI Seeks More Money to Combat Internet Child Pornography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh
Tuesday said that his agency is trying hard to protect children
from the "dark side" of the Internet, where pedophiles search for
victims.
</P>
<P>
But Freeh and Ernest Allen, president of the National Center
for Missing &AMP; Exploited Children, said law enforcement needs more
money to deal with the problem, which has increased along with the
popularity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a resource issue for us and other agencies,"
Freeh told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees
funding of the Justice Department, the parent agency of the FBI.
"I think we have the tools there. I just think we need more
resources."
</P>
<P>
"The dark side of that technology is that criminals or
pedophiles can reach into your home... without many, many
safeguards," Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said the FBI was attacking the problem through its
"Crimes Against Children" initiative, which covers sexual
exploitation of children, abductions and violent crimes.
