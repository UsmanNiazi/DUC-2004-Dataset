	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Federal Bureau of Investigation chief  
Louis Freeh says Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games could be the target of 
an attack by Islamic terrorist Osama Bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, in Australia giving advice on law and order issues, made  
his comments on Channel Nine television Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Sydney was at risk of attack by Bin Laden because  
of the large contingent of U.S. athletes and spectators attending 
the event, Freeh replied ``exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His threat, or Fatwah, (is) against not only Americans but the  
friends of America who we believe are clearly most of the world, 
and certainly our very close friends here in this part of the 
world,'' Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I think the Olympics, APEC, the America's Cup -- these are  
all opportunities for someone who has a terrorist agenda to take 
advantage of an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The APEC meeting of Asia Pacific leaders and the America's Cup  
yacht race will both be held in Auckland, New Zealand later this 
year.
