<HEADLINE> Freeh: Schools Must Teach Honesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teaching honesty, fairness and other essential  
values is crucial for students and public servants alike, FBI 
Director Louis J. Freeh told graduates of Marymount University on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said his interest in ethics was renewed by a recent trip  
to Normandy, France, where he saw the D-Day beaches. He contrasted 
the 19- and 20-year-olds who fought in World War II to today's 
generation, in which a majority of high school students say their 
biggest challenges are ethical ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said he tells new FBI agents that no matter how much they  
learn in training, the most important lessons come at age 2 or 3: 
tell the truth, be fair and compassionate, do not steal or lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the basic requirements that democracy particularly  
and civilization generally require of all of us,'' Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Education provides an important role in teaching ethics, Freeh  
said. He praised Marymount University, a Catholic school in 
Arlington, Va., for its Center for Ethical Concerns and said core 
values should be a stronger part of FBI training.
