<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. to Join Hands to Fight Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freeh, who arrived here Wednesday evening for a two-day working
visit, discussed ways with Rushailoto to qualify actions between
the FBI and the Russian Interior Ministry in the struggle against
organized crime, particularly against international terrorism,
according to the Russian media.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved the main result" in the cooperation of
institutions of law and order, Rushailo told the press.
</P>
<P>
"Our departments have built up confidence to a level that makes
it possible to fully implement the political accords of Russian
President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Bill Clinton and to
efficiently battle trans-national crime, terrorism, and economic
and computer offenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday negotiations with Freeh produced a decision on a
new phase in bilateral cooperation; the two sides intend to set up
a Russian-American group to coordinate efforts in "the most
promising spheres of anti-crime activity," Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
Freeh noted in turn the importance of cooperation between the
FBI and the Russian Interior Ministry saying, "Cooperation can
hardly be overestimated against the background of the
globalization of international criminality."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides have similar interests in taking measures
to end terrorism, money laundering and computer crimes.
</P>
<P>
The joint training of Russian Interior Ministry and FBI
personnel, which has been going on for years, is also very
important, Freeh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States will have joint teams of officers
to help solve computer crimes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Freeh met with Nikolai Patrushev, director of
Russia's Federal Security Service. They talked about expanding
bilateral cooperation in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Freeh and Mikhail Vanin, head of the Russian State
Customs Committee, also discussed cooperation between their
agencies in fighting crime in foreign trade. The two sides reached
an understanding on cooperation in the detection and prevention of
economic smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Freeh will travel to St. Petersburg later Friday for talks with
representatives of that city's law-enforcement agencies.
