<HEADLINE> Reno, Freeh Defend Selection of New FBI Lab Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Louis J.
Freeh today defended the selection of a physicist with no forensic
background to head the FBI crime lab, saying a scientist-manager
is needed to take the troubled facility in new directions.
</P>
<P>
FBI lab head Donald M. Kerr Jr., 58, is a physicist-engineer,
who from 1979 to 1985 headed the government's Los Alamos National
Laboratory that designed nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Reno told a news conference that Freeh broadened the search
beyond forensic scientists "when it became clear that the immense
challenges facing the laboratory's next director required a
brilliant scientist as well as a brilliant manager."
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Kerr's management skills would help the FBI build a
new laboratory, expected to be completed in summer 2000, at its
training facility in Quantico, Virginia, and help lead the lab
into new research on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and
computer crime.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Kerr's "remarkable background will be invaluable as
the FBI carries out its priority efforts to prevent terrorists
from using nuclear, biological or chemical weapons in the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Freeh said Kerr would hire four top scientists in the areas of
biology, chemistry, physical-material science and computers to
assist him.
</P>
<P>
Kerr said a report by the Justice Department inspector general
last April "made clear we have to tighten our procedures for
handling evidence and the way we communicate our results to
courts." He promised to "make sure our processes and protocols are
defensible and appropriate."
