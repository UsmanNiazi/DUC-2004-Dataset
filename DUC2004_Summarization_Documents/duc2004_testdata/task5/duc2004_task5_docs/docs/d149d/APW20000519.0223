<HEADLINE> Specter Warns Reno, Freeh on Memo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frustrated by the belated disclosure of key
memos in the fund-raising scandal, a key senator warned Friday he
may seek sanctions against Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI
Director Louis Freeh if more surprises surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., reacted angrily to the FBI's belated
disclosure this week that Freeh penned a memo in late 1996
suggesting a prosecutor was under pressure to drop the fund-raising
case to save Reno's job.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, often an ally of Freeh, said the director and Reno
should have disclosed the memo long ago but produced it only after
being formally subpoenaed by a Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't produce it until he got a subpoena ... I think
they're afraid that if they don't come across with the documents,
they may be liable for obstruction of justice,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very dissatisfied with the attorney general's performance
and said so many times, and the I think the director has an
explanation to make as to why he did not inform the public of the
contents of his memo,'' Specter added.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's Senate subcommittee is investigating the Justice
Department's handling of several sensitive cases, including
fund-raising and China espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and House Government Reform Committee chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind., are planning hearings next week to review Freeh's
memo. Burton said Friday he was less concerned about the FBI's
belated release of the memo and would focus instead on why Reno
discarded Freeh's urging to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Freeh memo suddenly appeared Wednesday night,
Specter said he was considering asking his colleagues to find the
Justice Department in contempt of Congress for slow and incomplete
production of documents in the fund-raising case.
</P>
<P>
   He said he may still proceed with the sanctions. ''If we find
that there are documents which they have not produced, we will push
for sanctions. In the face of their late production, we just might
consider sanctions anyhow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Thursday that Freeh wrote a memo
on Dec. 9, 1996, disclosing that he asked Reno and Justice
Department public integrity section (PIS) chief Lee Radek to step
aside from the fund-raising probe because of purported comments
made by Radek.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh quoted Radek third-hand as saying there was ''a lot of
'pressure' on him and PIS regarding this case because the attorney
general's job might hang in the balance.'' He also urged in the
memo that a ''junkyard dog'' -- his term for an aggressive
prosecutor -- be named to take over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Friday she never bowed to political pressure. ''I call
it like I see it, regardless of the consequences. I've got a
month-to-month lease on my apartment, and I've been prepared to go
home from the beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno added she did not recall Freeh briefing her on Radek's
purported remarks or ''talking about pressure because of the job. I
do have a recollection of him (Freeh) saying that we should get a
junkyard dog to prosecute the case, but I think that was said on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, likewise, said he doesn't recall making such comments and
wouldn't have because there was ''no basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton scoffed at their explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an epidemic of memory loss in that administration,''
he said. ''Nobody who has testified before my committee from the
president's chief counsel on down to the attorney general can
remember anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's because they can't held for perjury if they say they just
can't remember,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, former FBI Deputy Director Bill Esposito and FBI General
Counsel Larry Parkinson have been asked to appear at a hearing next
week before Specter's subcommittee, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito was the recipient of the Freeh memo and was identified
by Freeh as the agent to whom Radek made the purported comment.
