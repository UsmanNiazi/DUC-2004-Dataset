INQUIRY ON FBI CHIEF IN 1997 IS DISCLOSED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1997 the Justice Department briefly looked into
whether Attorney General Janet Reno should seek an independent
counsel to investigate allegations that Louis Freeh, the director
of the FBI, lied to Congress, according to government and
congressional officials on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary inquiry concluded that Freeh did not
intentionally mislead Congress when he gave an incorrect
explanation of why the head of the bureau's crime laboratory had
been suspended. Instead, investigators concluded that Freeh had
been misinformed, and they noted that he quickly corrected his
error in a letter to Congress when it was pointed out to him. As a
result, they concluded, there was no need for any criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the event occurred over three years ago, the reasons
and the way in which it surfaced this week involve the continuing
battle between the Clinton Justice Department and congressional
Republicans over Reno's handling of allegations of fund-raising
irregularities by Democrats in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary inquiry involving Freeh was contained in
documents sent by the Justice Department this week to the Senate
and House Judiciary Committees, which are looking into Reno's
decisions not to seek an independent counsel to investigate
Democratic fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to seek an independent counsel for Freeh came
just weeks before Reno apparently first declined to seek an
independent counsel to investigate Democratic fund-raising
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican on the Judiciary
Committee and an ardent critic of Reno, said the Justice Department
included the information about Freeh for highly suspect reasons.
``This information wasn't even in the scope of our subpoena for
information,'' Specter said in an interview. ``It was gratuitously
volunteered and they did it to beat up Freeh a little bit and to
help them defend their decision not to go after Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats declined to comment publicly on the
documents. Specter said the situations of Freeh and of Vice
President Al Gore were ``as different as night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Freeh was clearly shown to have made an innocent mistake
and corrected it quickly. The questions about Gore, he said,
involved whether he was telling the truth when he asserted he was
unaware that his fund-raising efforts were aimed at raising
so-called hard money _ money that is both limited and regulated by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said that the material
disclosing the preliminary inquiry about Freeh was part of a larger
document that was a direct response to the Judiciary Committee's
request for information about the campaign fund-raising
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate Judiciary Committee, at the request of Senator
Specter requested this body of material,'' said Carole Florman of
the Justice Department. ``It was therefore produced to the
committee under the accommodation that balances the department's
long-standing interest in maintaining confidentiality of our
deliberative material and the need for congressional oversight.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, Reno, who had once been a supporter of the
independent-counsel law, was believed to have become disenchanted
with it. Although she began to seek independent prosecutors less
often at the time she declined to do so for Freeh, she made her
most controversial decision nearly a year later when she authorized
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, to look into allegations
involving President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Reno said that under the
independent-counsel law that expired last June, the department had
no choice but to launch an inquiry into Freeh's congressional
testimony. She said that ``Director Freeh made an unintentional
mistake'' and that she had the utmost respect for his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the preliminary inquiry into whether he
intentionally misled Congress, Freeh was an outspoken advocate
within government circles for the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate the Democrats, especially Gore.
