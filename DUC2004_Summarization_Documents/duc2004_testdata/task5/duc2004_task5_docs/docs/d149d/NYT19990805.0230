<P>
   BOSTON -- In his first public remarks on the scandal that rocked
the Boston office of the FBI last year, FBI director Louis Freeh
says ``significant mistakes were made'' by local agents who
recruited Irish gangsters to inform on the Italian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   And, Freeh said, ``if'' a task force of FBI agents and Justice
Department prosecutors ``come(s) up with evidence that we can bring
within the statute of limitations, because there are some in this
case, you will see vigorous presentation and prosecution'' of the
local gents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let the chips fall where they may,'' Freeh said
Wednesday during a news conference at the Boston office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that the bureau was committed to finding James
``Whitey'' Bulger, the indicted South Boston crime boss turned
informant, who has been a fugitive for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that Bulger is in the running to be named to the
FBI's vaunted 10 Most Wanted list _ a designation long sought by
the local agents assigned to find him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, prosecutors investigating possible criminal
wrongdoing by Bulger's FBI handlers have been presenting evidence
to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That grand jury, according to sources, has heard evidence of
possible crimes by retired Special Agent John Connolly, who was
Bulger's handler for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the agents implicated are retired or the criminal
conduct dates back many years, Freeh said, ``There's nothing we
take more seriously than the integrity and honesty of our agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an agency to make excuses for either problems or
people who. . .have committed serious violations and crimes while
working for the FBI,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that the FBI's credibility has been damaged in
the fallout over its handling of Bulger and his criminal sidekick
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, Freeh said he didn't think the the
bureau's reputation had been ``indelibly'' harmed.
</P>
<P>
   He compared it to the taint which attached to the bureau after a
counterintelligence agent two years ago was discovered passing
secrets to Russian spies.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said the bureau was embarrassed by the espionage of
Special Agent Earl Pitts, who pleaded guilty to passing secrets to
the KGB, but not ``irrevocably'' damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh pointed out that no one yet knows if the alleged
wrongdoing of agents who handled high-level informants like Bulger
and Flemmi will result in the dismissal of extortion and
racketeering charges brought against Bulger, Flemmi, reputed new
England Mafia boss Francis P. ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme and
several associates in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After holding months of hearings lasting most of last year, US
District Judge Mark L. Wolf has yet to rule on defense motions to
dismiss the charges and suppress evidence. Flemmi says the charges
should be dismissed because he and Bulger were given permission to
commit crimes in exchange for information they gave the FBI on the
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Freeh said, the FBI is revising its policies on
handling criminal informants.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh stressed that the kind of wrongdoing Connolly and others
are alleged to have engaged in _ turning their backs on crimes
committed by informants, tipping them off to investigations,
exchanging gifts _ is neither ``representative or symptomatic'' of
the way the bureau's 29,000 employees operate.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he is concerned about losing the faith of the
public. Responding to relentless questions about the Bulger case
during the 20-minute news conference, Freeh said Bulger may be
added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when a panel in Washington
meets next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger, he said, would be given ``due consideration.'' Freeh
said that finding Bulger, who has been on the run since his Jan. 4,
1995 indictment, is a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he demurred when asked why that has not translated into a
higher profile for the 69-year-old Bulger. He acknowledged that the
Boston FBI has proposed Bulger for the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   After at first saying that he is not on the committee that
chooses the Top 10, Freeh admitted he does in fact carry some
weight with the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to 1950, the 10 Most Wanted list has led to the
capture of many a criminal, often with the public's help.
</P>
<P>
   An important consideration in putting fugitives on the list _
and one that works in Bulger's favor _ is whether the publicity
would enhance his chances of being captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may in fact put him on the Top 10 list,'' Freeh said later.
``He's as important as anyone on our Top 10 list.''
