<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Party Leader Calls for Further Efforts to Form  New government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chea Sim, president of the
ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and former president of the
National Assembly, urged the three parties Thursday to make
further efforts for the formation of a new government as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim made the remarks during his interview with the media
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim expressed his dissatisfaction with the discussions the
working groups carried out, saying they were deadlocked on some
unimportant issues such as asking for recounting the ballots,
changing the seat calculation formula and granting amnesty to five
opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
"It was widely believed that the working groups of three
parties have made no significant progress on the formation of the
government and other important issues, although they have been
working hard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, I hope the three major political parties speed up the
process and working even harder for the sake of the interests of
the nation and the country. To Cambodia, time is money," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said he wishes the three parties could make the
National Assembly function and a new government formed at the
second or third week of October.
</P>
<P>
"Hun Sen and I are prepared to hold talks with the Funcinpec
party President Prince Ranariddh at any time. We hope the Prince
come back from Bangkok as soon as possible," Chea Sim stated.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and opposition party leader Sam Rainsy left Siem Reap
for Bangkok on September 25, the day after the opening of the
National Assembly and the lifting of a travel ban on opposition
members, allegedly for personal, not political reasons. Sam Rainsy
is now in the United States to lobby the U.S. government not to
accept the Cambodian government formed by Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Now only 25 of the 43 Funcinpec Parliamentarians are in
Cambodia and the 15 of Sam Rainsy Party's Assembly members are all
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chem Sim called on all the parliamentarians to do their duty
and come back soon. He pledged there was no threats against their
parliamentary immunity and the King's stay in Phnom Penh has
provided the safeguard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chea Sim said the better way is through the three
party working group session and the two party meeting between the
CPP and Funcinpec being held simultaneously, because some
important issues were only directly related to the CPP and
Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Sam Rainsy, Chem Sim said Sam Rainsy has only
two choices, one is to participate in the coalition government and
other is to continue to act as an opposition party.
