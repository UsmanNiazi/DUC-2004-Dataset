	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The president of Cambodia's ruling
party called on Friday for opposition members of parliament to
return to the country and resume stalled negotiations to form a new
government.
	   Chea Sim, the president of strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party, said in a faxed statement that a new round of talks
should be limited to the ruling party and the senior opposition
party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Ranariddh has insisted that any talks also include the junior
opposition party led by Sam Rainsy.
	   After Hun Sen narrowly won a July election, Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy led a gradual exodus of opposition politicians to Bangkok
after a ceremonial convening of parliament in September.
	   The two-party opposition says Hun Sen has threatened to arrest
its leaders, making it impossible for them to negotiate inside
Cambodia.
	   Chea Sim dismissed the opposition's demand for talks outside the
country as ``political extortion'' and an attempt to overturn the
results of the election.
	   But in his bid to encourage opposition lawmakers to return, the
ruling party president said the government would guarantee
opposition lawmakers' safety upon their return.
	   ``The royal government will insure for these representatives
full protection for safety, devoid of threat and intimidation and
of any other kinds of provocation,'' Chea Sim said.
	   Despite general approval of the election as relatively free and
fair by most international observers, the opposition has claimed
the CPP achieved its victory through fraud and intimidation.
	   It insists its allegations must be thoroughly investigated
before agreeing to any coalition.
	   Chea Sim said that no matter what an investigation showed, the
ruling party would not accept a change in the results of the
election.
	   Chea Sim did hint that there was still room for compromise in a
new round of talks, saying, ``the Cambodian People's Party is
considering avenues to serve the interests of our nation.''
	   The ruling party president said he held hope negotiations could
lead to a summit of top party leaders chaired by King Norodom
Sihanouk in Phnom Penh.
	   But the aging monarch, noting that the three parties could not
even agree on a venue for the summit, has since declined to chair
the meeting.
