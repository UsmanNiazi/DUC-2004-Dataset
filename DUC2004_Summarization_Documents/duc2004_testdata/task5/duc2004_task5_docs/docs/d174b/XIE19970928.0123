<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) Chea Sim has denied reports that split has
appeared among CPP top leaders, saying that purpose of spreading
rumors of this kind is to create dissension in the party.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, also chairman of the National Congress, said in a
televised statement Saturday that the three CPP top leaders:
himself, Hun Sen, vice chairman and co-prime minister and Heng
Samrin, honorary chairman "are united as one."
</P>
<P>
After Hun Sen left Cambodia for visits on September 22, some
Cambodian newspapers, including those pro-Hun Sen, carried
articles, saying that Chea Sim factions would hold meetings to
topple Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, the atmosphere in Phnom Penh suddenly
became so tense that some foreign embassies even notified their
citizens to get prepared for contingencies.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said that there had been rumors recently that someone
wanted to seize me, and last night rumors went even farther as to
say that "Chea Sim has already been seized."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that some people said that Heng Samrin were
assembling troops to fight Hun Sen. "Why does Heng Samrin have to
fight Hun Sen? These are sheer rumors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said that "peace, development and progress are the
common desires shared by the Cambodian People, ... CPP leaders
will never do anything that goes against the will of the people."
</P>
<P>
He said that preparatory work for the general election to be
held in May 1998 was being conducted, and electoral laws and
political party law would be adopted by the Congress in the near
future.

Chea Sim also expressed hopes that the international community
would send observers to Cambodia and provide funds and
technological assistance for the election.
