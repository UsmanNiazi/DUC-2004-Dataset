	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ The widow and daughter of Pol Pot,
the late leader of Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge, have fled the
guerrilla group along with other defectors, Defense Minister Tea
Banh said Monday.
	   Pol Pot died on April 15 this year at the age of 73 while under
house arrest by his comrades at what was then the guerrillas' main
base in northern Cambodia. He had been toppled from his leadership
position last year.
	   His death, reportedly from heart failure, came as government
forces were slowly driving the guerrillas out of the base at Anlong
Veng, their last major stronghold.
	   Pol Pot's 40-year-old widow, Mea Son, was one of several
thousand refugees who encamped at the Thai border as fighting
flared around the base. She and her daughter Mea Sith, 14, made
their first public appearance there in front of journalists right
after her husband died. Her whereabouts since then had not been
known.
	   Pol Pot met Mea Son in 1985 when she was 27 and he was 60 and
married her two years later. Mea Son and her daughter described Pol
Pot after his death as a good husband and father.
	   He was better known to the world as the head of a brutal
communist regime whose extremist policies were responsible for the
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians in the late 1970s.
	   Pol Pot's first marriage in 1956 to fellow revolutionary Khieu
Ponnary was childless. She is said to have suffered a breakdown in
the 1980s and never recovered. It is unclear what happened to her
afterwards.
	   Mea Son is by all accounts a simple peasant woman, unlike Khieu
Ponnary, who had been an active leader in the Khmer Rouge movement.
	   Tea Banh said Monday that Mea Son and her daughter had defected
to the government along with two guerrilla officials, Tep Khunnal
and Khan Soeun, who had remained with the rebel group even after
its near-total collapse earlier this year. Their Sept. 11
defections were announced by the government last Friday.
	   Tep Khunnal was one of the last so-called ``intellectuals'' to
remain with the group as its remnants hid in the jungle under the
command of veteran guerrilla fighter Ta Mok, who has a reputation
for brutality. Khan Soeun was a military commander.
	   Like the two men, Mea Son and her daughter are said to have
settled in Phnom Malai, a former guerrilla base on the Thai border
that is now home to many defectors.
	   Tea Banh said Mea Son and her daughter were staying with So
Hong, a nephew of Pol Pot who defected more than a year ago.
	   He said Mea Son left because she could not stay under Ta Mok's
pressure anymore and had no one to turn to.
