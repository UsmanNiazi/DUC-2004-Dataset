<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chea Mun, commander of the
Cambodian Army's Fourth Military Zone, told Xinhua Thursday
that he cannot confirm reports that former Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot is dead.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I have learned, Da Mok, current head of the Khmer
Rouge, took Pol Pot to Thailand a few days ago when they were
retreating from their Anlong Veng stronghold," said the Cambodian
commander, who is in charge of the military operations against
Anlong Veng.

<P>
"As the situation along the Cambodian-Thai border is still
complicated, it is very difficult to get accurate information
about Pol Pot and Da Mok for the time being," Chea Mun said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are making contacts with the Thai military through
our defense ministry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot, 71, has reportedly died of heart attack on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Khieu Kanaridh, secretary of state for the Cambodian
Information Ministry, told Xinhua that he also cannot confirm Pol
Pot's death.
</P>
<P>
"We are now making contacts with the Thai government and Khmer
Rouge separatists," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The Cambodian royal government's position is that no
matter which side gets hold of Pol Pot or his body, they should
immediately turn him or it over to the royal government."
