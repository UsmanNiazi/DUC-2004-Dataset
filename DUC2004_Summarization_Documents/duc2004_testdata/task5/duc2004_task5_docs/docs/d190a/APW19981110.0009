Government suspends newspaper for criticizing Cambodian monarch

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government handed down
a suspension order Tuesday to a newspaper calling for King Norodom
Sihanouk to stand trial for crimes against humanity.
	   Khieu Kanharith, secretary of state for the Information
Ministry, signed the order suspending the National Salvation
newspaper because it violated a constitutional provision
stipulating that the Cambodian monarch is inviolable.
	   In its very first edition published Tuesday, National Salvation
printed on the front page portraits of King Norodom Sihanouk and
Pol Pot and an article headlined, ``For justice, try King Sihanouk
together with Pol Pot.''
	   Pol Pot headed the Khmer Rouge regime between 1975 and 1979 that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians. He died of a
heart attack in the jungles last year as the dwindling remnants of
his guerrilla army fractured.
	   Sihanouk, at the time a prince, was Cambodia's ruler in 1970
when he was toppled by a U.S.-backed military coup during the
height of the war in neighboring Vietnam.
	   He lent his support and popular appeal to the Khmer Rouge, then
a little-known guerrilla force, to fight the new regime. He was
made a prisoner in his palace when the Khmer Rouge took power.
Several of his family members were killed.
	   ``King Sihanouk is the prime person responsible for the loss of
lives of more than 3 million Cambodians under the Democratic
Kampuchea regime,'' said the newspaper. Most historians consider
that figure too high.
	   ``An international tribunal should include him in the list of
genocide's criminals and try him together with Pol Pot for justice
to be served,'' the newspaper said.
	   Publisher Chhea Vary, 32, said he stood by the article and said
part of journalistic freedom was the right to express an opinion.
	   ``I don't think my article is abusive to the king,'' Chhea Ravy
said.
	   Khieu Kanharith has also issued a warning against the publisher
of another newspaper, New News, which accused the 76-year-old
monarch last week of being the founder of the Khmer Rouge regime.
	   The United Nations is sending a team to Cambodia next week to
sift through evidence gathered against the Khmer Rouge over the
past few years to determine what kind of crimes surviving leaders
could be charged with and how they could be tried if caught.
	   Sihanouk has said he supports bringing Khmer Rouge criminals
before an international tribunal.
