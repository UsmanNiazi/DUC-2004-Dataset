Cambodian tyrant's widow marries late husband's aide

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The widow of Pol Pot, the notorious
leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement, has married
one of her late husband's aides, a guerrilla defector said Tuesday.
	   Yim Phanna, a former Khmer Rouge commander, confirmed reports
this week in Phnom Penh newspapers that Pol Pot's widow, Mea Som,
had married Tep Khunnal, formerly a middle-ranking Khmer Rouge
functionary, shortly after the two defected to the government in
September. Pol Pot's 14-year-old daughter, Mea Sith, defected along
with her mother.
	   ``They had a small ceremony arranged when they were in a refugee
camp in Thailand,'' said Yim Phanna, whose own defection earlier
this year led to the government's capture of the rebels' stronghold
in Anlong Veng. ``Maybe Pol Pot asked him to take care of her. She
has no one to rely on since the contemptible Pol Pot died.''
	   Pol Pot died on April 15 this year at the age of 73 while under
house arrest by his comrades. He had been toppled from his
leadership position last year.
	   His death, reportedly from heart failure, came as government
forces were driving the guerrillas out of Anlong Veng, their last
major stronghold.
	   Mea Som was one of several thousand refugees who encamped at the
Thai border as fighting flared around the base.
	   Tep Khunnal was one of the last so-called ``intellectuals'' to
remain with the group as its remnants hid in the jungle under the
command of veteran guerrilla fighter Ta Mok, who has a reputation
for brutality.
	   Pol Pot married Mea Som in 1987. She and her daughter described
Pol Pot after his death as a good husband and father.
	   He was better known to the world as the head of a brutal
communist regime whose extremist policies were responsible for the
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians in the late 1970s.
	   Pol Pot's first marriage in 1956 to fellow revolutionary Khieu
Ponnary was childless. She is said to have suffered a breakdown in
the 1980s and never recovered. It is unclear what happened to her
afterward.
