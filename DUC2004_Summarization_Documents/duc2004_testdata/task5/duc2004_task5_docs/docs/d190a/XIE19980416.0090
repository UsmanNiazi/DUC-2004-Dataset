<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pol Pot, former Cambodian
Khmer Rouge leader, died of heart attack on Wednesday night, the
Khmer Rouge broadcasting station announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Pol Pot, 73, died at 11:15 p.m. (local
time) on a hill near Anlong Veng, the last stronghold of Khmer
Rouge near the Cambodian-Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Another report coming from the scene said that Khmer Rouge had
shown off his body to some reporters and Thai officers to prove
his death.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot's wife and daughter were among the only mourners along
with five young Khmer Rouge soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some Khmer Rouge soldiers were quoted as saying that Pol Pot
would be cremated in three days.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot, the most powerful leader of Khmer Rouge, lost his
power in a bloody internal struggle of the organization last year
and was then put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The defections of a large number of Khmer Rouge troops on March
26 enabled the Cambodian government forces to capture Anlong Veng
and push Khmer Rouge remainders into jungles near the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Chea Mun, commander of the Cambodian Army in the Anlong Veng
zone, said Thursday that Ta Mok, current head of the Khmer Rouge,
had taken Pol Pot with him when he retreated from Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Nou, who had been assigned to guard Pol Pot, said that Pol
Pot died in a hut built for him after he lost his power.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Khieu Kanaridh, secretary of state for the
Cambodian Information Ministry, told Xinhua, "the Cambodian
government's position is that any side which gets hold of Pol Pot
or his body should immediately turn him or it over to the royal
government."
</P>
<P>
So far, there also exist calls for Pol Pot to be brought before
the International Court of Justice in the Hague to stand trial for
war crimes and crimes against humanity.
