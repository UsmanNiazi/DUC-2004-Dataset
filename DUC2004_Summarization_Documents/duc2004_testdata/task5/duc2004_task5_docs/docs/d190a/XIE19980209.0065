Khmer Rough leader Pol Pot has serious health problems.

"I have heard that Pol Pot's health is in critical condition
and I think that his old age and his living life in the jungle
leads to the above condition," Ieng Sary said.

Pol Pot lives in Khmer Rouge's last strong hold of Anlong Veng,
northern Cambodia near Thai border.
