	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A Cambodian prosecutor has opened an  
investigation to determine whether the top leaders of the brutal 
Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement should face trial, the justice 
minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation announced by Justice Minister Uk Vithun is  
separate from a U.N. effort to try Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide 
in either an international or Cambodian court. 
</P>
<P>
	Uk Vithun said he had ordered appeals court prosecutors to begin  
a review of a 1979 conviction of late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot 
and his deputy, Ieng Sary. Pol Pot died last year and Ieng Sary 
defected to the government in return for a pardon in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The order marks the first step taken by Hun Sen's government to  
convene a trial against architects of the Cambodian genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to look at this first before we can answer what the  
ministry can do next,'' Uk Vithun said after a meeting of Prime 
Minister Hun Sen's cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pol Pot's Maoist-inspired regime between 1975 and 1979 forced  
Cambodians into slave labor camps and caused the deaths of one 
person in five from overwork, starvation, disease and executions. 
At least 2 million people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressured to bring recent Khmer Rouge defectors Nuon Chea and  
Khieu Samphan to trial, Hun Sen reversed his stance last week and 
came out in favor of a trial for the men -- the top architects of 
the movement's genocidal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Sen is Cambodia's most powerful politician and the court  
system, which is in shambles, is easily influenced. Many people 
believe that a Cambodian trial, unsupervised by the international 
community, would fail to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear what a review of Pol Pot's and Ieng Sary's  
conviction would accomplish, other than buy time for Hun Sen to 
appease critics who are calling for someone to finally be held 
accountable for the Khmer Rouge reign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Vietnam invaded and ousted the Khmer Rouge from  
power 20 years ago, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary were sentenced to death 
in a show trial organized by the new, Hanoi-installed government. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1979 trial did not cover Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, two of  
Pol Pot's inner circle. They are staying at a former rebel 
stronghold, Pailin, nominally under government control but in fact 
run by Ieng Sary. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Khmer Rouge officials in recent days have threatened that  
attempts to violate the deal and bring the pair before a tribunal 
could rekindle civil war.
