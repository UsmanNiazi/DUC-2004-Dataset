<HEADLINE> Pol Pot May be Really Dead, Government Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pol Pot, former Cambodian
Khmer Rouge leader, may be really dead this time, Cambodia's
co-Minister of Defense Tea Banh said on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh told Xinhua by telephone he believed that Pol Pot was
dead this time because of his poor health.
</P>
<P>
However, the royal government could not confirm the news of Pol
Pot's death yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to senior Thai military officials, Pol Pot died of a
heart attack on Wednesday night deep inside the northern Cambodian
jungle close to the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio also broadcast Thursday the
death of Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Kanarhidh, secretary of state for the Information
Ministry, said Thursday that the Cambodian royal government was
contacting the Thai military and the sections of Khmer Rouge to
confirm the death of Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kanarhidh said that the Cambodian government's
position is that any side getting hold of Pol Pot or his body
should immediately turn him or it to the royal government.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot, the most powerful leader of Khmer Rouge, lost his
power in a bloody internal struggle of Khmer Rouge last year and
was then put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
So far, there exist calls for Pol Pot to be brought before the
International Court of Justice in the Hague to stand trial for war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
