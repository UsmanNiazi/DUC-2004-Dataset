	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former President P.W. Botha came out
the loser by refusing to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, panel chairman Desmond Tutu testified Thursday.
	   The retired Anglican archbishop was the latest witness to
testify against
	   the last hard-line leader of white rule who, as he has done
throughout his trial, looked on impassively.
	   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
activities, said Botha had humiliated himself by facing criminal
charges in court instead of complying with a subpoena to testify
before the Truth Commission.
	   ``The humiliation is the accused sitting here and I sought to
spare him that,'' Tutu said.
	   Botha has called the commission ``a circus,'' claiming it is
victimizing him by wanting him to appear in person when he has
submitted more than 1,700 pages of written answers to commission
questions.
	   In almost six hours of testimony, Tutu was grilled by defense
lawyer Lappe Laubscher, who accused the commission of ignoring
incidents where the African National Congress _ which waged a
guerrilla campaign against apartheid _ was reluctant to submit
information.
	   ``In the case of Mr. Botha you charge him, in the case of the
ANC you do nothing,'' Laubscher said.
	   While denying any bias, Tutu said he could not ignore the fact
that apartheid governments like Botha's were inherently wrong,
while the struggle against white rule was fought as a ``just war.''
	   ``I am not morally neutral about apartheid,'' he said ``It is
evil and I don't make any bones about it.''
	   Botha, 82, is being tried for contempt for snubbing the Truth
Commission. He faces up to two years in prison and unspecified
fines if convicted.
	   Earlier, apartheid's most notorious killer, ex-police death
squad commander Eugene de Kock, testified that he believed the
murders and bombings he carried in defense of apartheid had been
sanctioned from the highest levels.
	   De Kock is serving a 212-years prison sentence for his crimes.
He called his former political bosses cowards who had sold out the
footsoldiers who carried out their dirty work.
	   The trial is being held in the southern coastal city of George,
near Botha's retirement home.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the ANC. The talks culminated in all-race
elections in 1994, which the ANC won.
