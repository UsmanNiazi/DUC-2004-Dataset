 &HT;    Tutu to have exploratory surgery

   ATLANTA _ South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 68, plans to
enter Emory University Hospital on Thursday for surgery to
determine if cancer initially found in his prostate gland has
spread elsewhere in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu received the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in
transforming South Africa from a strictly segregated society into a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The prostate cancer was found and treated in 1997, but doctors
have discovered it has returned.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday by Emory officials, Tutu said he
understood it was not unusual for cancer to recur two years after
radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer has not spread, Tutu said he plans to undergo
cryosurgery, which will freeze the affected tissue with liquid
nitrogen. ``If it has spread, I am likely to undergo renewed
hormone treatment, which ran concurrently with my radiation therapy
in 1997, but I am feeling fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu is a visiting theology professor at Emory, as well as chair
of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in his home country. In
an interview last week with The London Daily Telegraph, he said
having cancer had, in some ways, been a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sharpened my focus and made me concentrate on things
that matter: my wife, my three daughters and son, the smiles on my
grandchildren's faces, the smell of flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   He has kept a busy schedule, speaking in recent weeks to
audiences as diverse as the National Press Club in Washington and a
gymnasium full of schoolchildren in Atlanta.
