<HEADLINE> Scholars Seek New Image of God  </HEADLINE>

	   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Former archbishop of South Africa Desmond Tutu
joined several prominent theologians on Saturday to urge religious leaders to
work together to find a new image of God for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No religion can claim to have the whole truth about the mystery'' of
faith, Tutu said. ``The logic of faith will get through to even the dumbest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, spoke at a news conference before he
addressed the ``God at 2000'' conference at Oregon State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu ended the two-day conference with an address that followed traditional
Christian teachings, talking about a masculine, judgmental God more interested
in individual sinners than the universe.
</P>
<P>
	   He credited prayer with helping resolve apartheid in South Africa and called
on people to pray for resolution of conflicts in places such as Northern Ireland
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Tutu also urged Christians to embrace other faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gandhi was not a Christian, but if you say Gandhi was not a good man, you
are not speaking my language,'' Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Author and theologian Marcus Borg, who teaches at Oregon State, invited Tutu
and five of the world's most influential religious scholars to talk about how
the image of God has changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Borg opened the conference Friday by saying his view of God changed
dramatically from the stern lawgiver he learned about as a boy to a God that is
beyond the understanding of any religion and ``dwelling within each of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged Christians to open themselves to other religions that see God
as the entire universe, and to reject ``supernatural theism,'' or reducing God
to human dimensions as an individual personality who meddles with the universe.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other speakers were Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, an author and National
Public Radio commentator who specializes in studies of Jewish mysticism; Seyyed
Hossein Nasr, a George Washington University professor considered one of the
world's foremost scholars on Islam; Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun and
author; and Karen Armstrong, a former Roman Catholic nun turned TV commentator
in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Chittister said a more feminine image of God is needed because the Earth is
in danger from overpopulation and pollution, and needs nurturing, not
punishment. But she added that any image of God should be beyond ``any color or
gender.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong said she has drawn her image of God from three major Western
religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   She said compassion and the ``Golden Rule'' of treating others with
compassion was perhaps more important than seeking God in a church or through
religion.
