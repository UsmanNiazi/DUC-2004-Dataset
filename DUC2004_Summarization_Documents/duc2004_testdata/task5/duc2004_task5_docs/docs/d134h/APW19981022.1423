	   ATLANTA (AP) _ For two years, Archbishop Desmond Tutu listened
to account upon account of burning bodies and shallow graves. He
forgets many of the names he heard at hearings of the South African
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but he carries the stories
like creases in a cassock.
	   His gait is heavy as he walks the campus of Atlanta's Emory
University, where he will teach theology. Just four years ago at
Emory, he bounded into rooms and often ended his anecdotes with
boisterous laughter. Today the 67-year-old archbishop, who received
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, enters a room cautiously and sits
stiffly, as if bracing for questions about prisons and pits.
	   ``I'm vulnerable. I know I'm fragile,'' Tutu said, drawing out
each word. ``I laugh easily and I make other people laugh, but I
also cry easily.''
	   He had already spent three decades ministering to a nation under
apartheid, and saying eulogies for its victims, when President
Nelson Mandela asked him to head the truth commission. The panel,
formed to investigate apartheid-era abuses and to grant amnesty to
perpetrators who confessed fully to politically motivated crimes,
releases its final report on Thursday, Oct. 29.
	   His experience might have cushioned him. But it didn't. The
2,000 testimonies of torture, rape and murder were a running
narrative of the injustices he had fought his entire life.
	   Still, he believes a country has to confront the brutality of
its history before forgiveness is possible, even if that means
asking survivors to relive their trauma and listeners to make sense
of the terror. And that includes an archbishop who thought he'd
seen everything.
	   ``At home, we thought we knew just how awful the system had
been,'' Tutu said. ``But when you heard accounts of what had
happened to people and found them saying _ `They stripped me ...
and opened a drawer and shoved my breasts into the drawer and
slammed it on my nipples,' _ you realize then what had happened.
	   ``When you heard the perpetrators in an amnesty hearing saying,
`We abducted him. We gave him drugged coffee, shot him in the head
and burned his body, and then we had a barbecue on the side,' you
realize the depths to which we can sink.''
	   He had read the statistics about violence. ``Now the statistics
were coming alive,'' he said. ``And we were devastated by the
extent of the evil.''
	   Tutu became the most public of father confessors. During the
early televised truth commission hearings, South Africans watched
his every expression. When a former African National Congress
guerrilla told from a wheelchair of being beaten and tortured by
the police, they saw Tutu hold his head in his hands and cry.
	   Anglican priest Michael Battle, a former adjutant to the
archbishop in Johannesburg, was not surprised. ``The truth
commission was the final revelation and (Tutu) had to relive the
pain,'' he said. Nor was his old friend, Anglican priest Norman
Montjane, who said Tutu has always ``entered into the agony and
tragedy. He himself is part of the sadness.''
	   If the hearings were often cathartic, they were frustrating as
well.
	   Facing his old friend, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Tutu begged
her to apologize for her alleged role in kidnapping and murder
committed by a gang of youths with whom she was associated. She
offered only vague regrets.
	   ``I was devastated,'' said Tutu.
	   When apartheid era presidents Frederik W. de Klerk and P.W.
Botha refused to testify, claiming they were not responsible for
crimes committed in the name of white rule, Tutu could not contain
his outrage.
	   ``It's an incredible thing that (blacks) who still live in
shacks, squalor and poverty, come to work in your beautiful homes,
and they don't say, `We're going to murder all of you in your
beds,''' Tutu said in an interview with the South African
Broadcasting Commission.
	   Whites accused Tutu and the commission of having a pro-ANC bias;
blacks accused him of being soft on whites. And even his friend,
Muslim theologian Farid Esack, called for ``the de-Desmond
Tutu-fication of the truth commission'' so that a Christian
perspective wouldn't dominate. Tutu countered that there were
Muslim, Hindu, and Jewish commissioners.
	   Besides, he added, reconciliation is not unique to Christians.
``When an atheist husband quarrels with an atheist wife, doesn't
one say, `I'm sorry'?''
	   More troubling to him were those who suggested the commission
was forcing forgiveness from traumatized survivors. ``You can't
frog-march people into forgiveness,'' he said. ``You can never
blame anybody who feels they are unable to forgive. ... You can
only say to someone that ultimately you hope for forgiveness.''
	   When public opinion polls revealed that the majority of South
Africans, particularly whites, felt the commission has increased
tensions in race relations, Tutu said that the panel's job was to
promote the ongoing process of reconciliation not to ensure it
would happen immediately.
	   So far, amnesty has been granted to only 125 people who
convinced the panel that their crimes were political and that they
were telling the entire truth. Amnesty hearings will continue after
the release of the commission's final report.
	   The report could urge prosecution of those who have refused to
testify. Leaders from both sides of the apartheid struggle have
received notices that they may be portrayed negatively in the
panel's summation of the violence.
	   As the effort moves forward, friends worry that Tutu has
absorbed too much of that violence. That concern intensified when
he underwent surgery last year for prostate cancer.
	   ``Some people wondered whether the cancer that I had was not in
part the result of the working out of this,'' he said. ``I don't
know I would not have cancer in any case, but maybe the body reacts
to all of the stresses.''
	   After a return trip to South Africa for the report's release,
Tutu will settle in at Emory to write a book and teach a spring
course on his ministry.
