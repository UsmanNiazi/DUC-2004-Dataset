 &HT;    TUTU URGES U.S. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO SOUTH AFRICA'S
GROWING ECONOMY
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on the United States
to increase its financial support of South Africa during a speech
at the National Press Club on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the United States gives Israel $3.5 billion annually
in foreign aid, Tutu said South Africa needs similar assistance as
it struggles to right its economy eight years after abolishing
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give South Africa $2 billion for the next five years,'' Tutu
told a luncheon crowd at the National Press Club here. ``Here is a
chance to help a country become a vibrant economy. When South
Africa prospers, it will be the engine driving the economy of the
continent''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and a visiting professor of theology at Emory University
in Atlanta, sprinkled some humor into his speech on how the country
has fared in a post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous privilege to come to places such as this
where we were once asking for help,'' said Tutu, whose impassioned
pleas and sermons helped end apartheid in South Africa. ``You gave
help. We accomplished the goal. We are free''
</P>
<P>
   Many had predicted that bloodshed would accompany the transition
to a democratic society, and that black South Africans would not
remain committed to reconciliation once in power, Tutu recalled.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which granted amnesty for
politically motivated crimes as long as full disclosure was made by
the perpetrators, was a particular source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Nobel Peace laureate remarked with glee that the nation
has not collapsed under black leadership and that it is doing
better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our banks work,'' he said, alluding to the financial crises
that have plagued other nations such as Russia. ``We have a
horrendous legacy but also remarkable achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   While crime, high unemployment levels, and incidents of
corruption remain, there is little chance of regression into some
of the horrific abuses that occurred under apartheid, Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki, president of South Africa, though not as
``flamboyant'' as international icon Nelson Mandela _ ``he is
actually quite British'' in dress _ exhibits the same commitment to
reconciliation among South Africans and rebuilding its economy,
Tutu said. Mbeki is the second president elected since the end of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Tutu has suggested that the United States
consider forming its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission on
slavery. The archbishop said that while he did not want to
interfere in other nation's affairs, a similar commission might be
a useful endeavor for the United States to explore as a route to
racial healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to say that it's an infallible formula,'' Tutu said,
adding that certain factors must be in place for it to be
successful _ one, leaders must be ready to take risks; and two, the
people must realize that their opponents are potential friends, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Tutu was named the second winner of the
Sydney Peace Prize by the Sydney University Peace Foundation.
