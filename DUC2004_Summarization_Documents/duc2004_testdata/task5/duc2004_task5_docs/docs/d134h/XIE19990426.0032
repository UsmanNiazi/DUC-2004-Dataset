<HEADLINE> Archbishop Tutu Awarded German Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the South
African Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was honored with a German
prize Sunday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The Dietrich-Bonhoeffer Prize, named after a German theologian
who opposed the Nazi regime and was hanged by the Nazis in 1945,
was awarded for Tutu's role as chairman of the South African Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a church service at the French Cathedral in
Berlin, Tutu thanked German churches for their support to his work
during South Africa's apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
"Our victory is also your victory," Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
The prize belongs to all the South African people, he said,
adding, "My people are incredibly wonderful."
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Kaiser/Guetersloher publishing firm, which
funded the prize, said the TRC under Tutu's leading had enabled
the longed-for reconciliation in South Africa and initiated the
unity of a democratic country.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the victims of apartheid have forgiven the apartheid
perpetrator, and "the world now finds out (in South Africa)
something else than revenge."
</P>
<P>
But South Africa probably needs generations of time to heal all
the wounds that apartheid policy has left for the country, Deputy
Chairman of the TRC Reverend Alex Borraine said.
