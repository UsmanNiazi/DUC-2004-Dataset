   ATLANTA _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu preached about the family of
God on Thursday to a community that feels as if it's losing a
beloved brother and uncle as he leaves his teaching post at Emory
University's Candler School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   With the sunlight of a bright spring day streaming in, the small
man with the powerful presence kept a packed house spellbound under
the soaring ceiling of the university's 400-seat Cannon Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are sisters and brothers, a gift to one another,'' he told
them, ``children of God.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, he said, they have the right to address the creator as
``Daddy God, Papa God ... with intimacy and warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he added, ``is mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, 68, a Nobel peace laureate for his work against apartheid
in his native South Africa, has taught courses at Emory's
550-student theology school for the last two academic years. He
conducted the last chapel service of the school year as his own
farewell to the theology school and the 155 students who are
graduating. They, in turn, honored him with a traditional South
African hymn.
</P>
<P>
   Don Drenth of Montgomery, Ala., a second-year theology student
and member of the Episcopal Church, took a class on
``Transfiguration, Forgiveness and Reconciliation'' from Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings tears to my eyes every time I hear him speak,'' she
said. ``To be part of his family and know that he's part of mine is
very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my goodness!'' said Charles Foster, interim dean of
Candler, when asked what Tutu had meant to the faculty. ``The
generosity of his spirit, the depth of his compassion, the freedom
with which he enters into all sorts of situations and relationships
has demonstrated to us what it means to be a tranforming,
reconciling Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu's farewell message _ which followed an Academy Awards-like
litany of thanks to everyone from the doctors who treated his
prostate cancer to the staff who mowed his lawn _ was not all
warmth and fuzziness. It carried a punch _ the responsibility of
treating others as kin.
</P>
<P>
   How, he asked, can a family support ``obscene amounts of money
in what you call the defense budget'' while some of the world's
children lack food, clean water and health care? Or let ``Third
World nations groan under unpayable debt?''
</P>
<P>
   God dreams of a day when ``people matter more than things'' and
``when there are no outsiders, all belong,'' he said. ``And God
says, 'I have no one except you to help me realize my dream, and
God says, 'Please, help me.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he had finished his sermon, presided over the communion
table and graciously received a parting gift of a sculpture, people
crowded around to ask the archbishop to sign their programs and
have his picture made with them. He fulfilled every request.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said he will ``partly'' remain in the United States through
the summer, with trips to Wales and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu news conference after the service, Tutu said he
and his wife Leah will cherish their time in the city. ``Atlanta,
with its history in the Civil Rights movement, has always been a
place that has a special place in our hearts.''
