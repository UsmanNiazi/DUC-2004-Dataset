<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TRC Lays Charges Against Botha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) today formally laid criminal
charges against former state president P W Botha after he failed
to turn up at a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
Botha was served with a subpoena on December 5 to appear
before the TRC at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) today for the hearing on the
activities of the former State Security Council (SSC).
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn has asked police to
investigate the charges against Botha after TRC Chairman Desmond
Tutu lodged the case with him, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
He also gave Botha's lawyers time up to January 2 to explain
why the former president should not be prosecuted for failing to
obey the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
"The legal adviser of Mr. Botha has approached me and asked
for an opportunity to make written representations in respect of
facts unknown to me. Time being of the essence, I have given them
until January 2, 1998, after which time, I will make my decision
on all the facts and the law."
</P>
<P>
Should he decide to prosecute Botha, he would not arrest him,
but issue a summon requiring him to appear in a magistrate's
court within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
Tutu was saddened by Botha's repeated refusal to testify
before his commission.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very conciliatory and accommodating. We were
aware that he is a former state president and not as young as he
used to be."
</P>
<P>
Botha has defied three TRC subpoenas. Under the founding bill
of the TRC, he might face a fine and/or up to two years in jail
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Tutu failed to lay charges against Botha on December 5 owing
to a defection of the second subpoena. The subpoena told Botha
the date and venue of the hearing but did not specify the hour.
</P>
<P>
The TRC issued a third subpoena on the same day, ordering him
to appear at 9 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 81, has repeatedly said that he would rather be
prosecuted than appear before the TRC, which he described as a
"circus."
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, sent a fax this week to TRC deputy
chairman, Alex Boraine, spelling out why the former National
Party leader refused to obey the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
The fax, which was made known today, said Botha questioned the
motivation for the subpoena, believing that the reason for the
hearing was not to get information but to "humiliate and abuse"
him.
</P>
<P>
Tutu rejected the allegations, saying: "We are a forum that
does not seek to ridicule anybody."
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was president between 1984 and 1989, chaired the
SSC, a powerful "inner cabinet", at the peak of apartheid
conflict.
