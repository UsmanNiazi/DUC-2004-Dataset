 &HT;    Archbishop Tutu in Atlanta for a year as professor
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel

<P>
   ATLANTA _ While condemning attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu Friday stopped short
of embracing American military retaliation aimed at terrorist camps
in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not myself too comfortable with, `We hit them.''' Tutu
said Friday after arriving at Emory University, where he will spend
a year as a visiting professor of theology. ``Are we sure that the
targets are accurate?''
</P>
<P>
   Awarded the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
campaign in South Africa, Tutu said no one should ``ever have truck
with terror wherever it may happen.'' The difficulty, he said, is
how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it will be OK to try and find the people who are
the ringleaders who are responsible for giving the orders,'' said
Tutu, 66. ``We've got to be very careful that we don't, in trying
to counteract, find that we are ourselves eroding the very
structures of the law. I mean, there is international law, and
one's obviously concerned that it seems that in retaliating in the
fashion that appeared to have happened, international law, morality
_ that all of those are put in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearied by his daylong trip from Cape Town, Tutu made the first
appearance connected with his arrival at Emory to teach two courses
in the spring. He wore khaki pants, a blue blazer and a
wine-colored shirt as he spoke for 20 minutes before campus staff
drove him away in a Saturn station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said he looked forward to unwinding after two years of
chairing South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which
is investigating crimes committed during the country's period of
white rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who will attend a faculty retreat this weekend, arrived on
campus the day a judge fined and sentenced former apartheid
president P.W. Botha for ignoring a summons from Tutu's commission.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he supported a jail sentence for Botha, Tutu said, ``Of
course not. We are not blood thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The TRC does not seek to gloat, does not want to find the
truth in order to humiliate or belittle people or embarrass
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in failing health, Botha led the country during some of the
bloodiest days of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in his worst nightmare did he ever think that he would sit
in a court presided over by a black magistrate,'' Tutu said. ``I
think there is an appropriateness in demonstrating that this is a
moral universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral symmetry, a moral appreciation in what has
taken place. He has been found guilty in an open court where he had
the opportunity of being defended by lawyers of his own choice _
something he did not allow opponents at the time he was state
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate matter, Tutu revealed the TRC uncovered letters
that may document South Africa and other countries plotted to kill
U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold in 1961. Hammarskjold and
15 others died in a plane crash while working on a peace agreement
between Congo and a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   The documents referred to aircraft sabotage and include
correspondence among the South African military, the CIA and Great
Britain, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported. At Emory, Tutu
conceded the letters may be disinformation planted during an era
when the Soviet Union favored such ruses.
</P>
<P>
   But, Tutu added, ``It isn't something that is so bizarre. Things
of that sort have happened in the past. That is why you can't
dismiss it as totally, totally incredible.''
