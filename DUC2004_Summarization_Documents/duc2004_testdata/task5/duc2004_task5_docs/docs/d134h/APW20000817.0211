<HEADLINE> Tutu Returns to South Africa  </HEADLINE>

   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a
leading activist in the struggle against apartheid, returned home
from a two-year sabbatical in the United States Thursday, saying he
planned to take a well-deserved rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so wonderful to be back -- it's enough to move one to
tears,'' he told reporters after arriving at Cape Town's airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who underwent surgery for prostate cancer in November last
year, said his recovery had been slower than expected and pledged
to maintain a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to come home to sleep. We have a cadre of outstanding
new leaders. We oldies, certainly I, should give them space to show
off their worth,'' he said. ''It is now time I move away from
center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Anglican archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his role in fighting white rule which ended with
all-race election in 1994, subsequently chaired a commission which
probed apartheid-era abuses and gave amnesty to those who confessed
of their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said the government and those who benefitted from apartheid
had a duty to pay reparations to people identified by the
commission as victims of the evil system.
</P>
<P>
   The jovial archbishop is widely revered and loved in South
Africa, with his personable manner endearing him to people across
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who was lecturing theology at Emory University in Atlanta,
showed his manner had not changed while he was away from South
Africa. He went down on his knee to tie a photographer's shoelace
and enthusiastically embraced supporters who had arrived to welcome
him home.
