 &HT;    Hospitalization is denied for suspect

   ATLANTA _ A Rockdale County judge Tuesday turned down a request
to hospitalize Heritage High School shooting suspect Anthony
``T.J.'' Solomon for psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed door meeting with Juvenile Court Judge William
Schneider and Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read, lawyers for
the Rockdale teen, who is under a suicide watch, maintained that he
is severely depressed and needs more help than can be offered at
the Gwinnett Youth Detention Center, where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider declined to discuss the meeting. Don Samuel, one of
Solomon's lawyers, said the judge agreed that the 15-year-old needs
psychiatric help but apparently was not convinced that the problems
warranted moving him.
</P>
<P>
   However, defense lawyers said the judge left open the
possibility that he might reconsider if psychological exams on
Solomon by the state and defense are more compelling. Ed Garland,
another of Solomon's attorneys, said Ed Regnier, a clinical
psychologist from Sarasota, Fla., is evaluating Solomon for the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Read objected to the defense request because, he said, he did
not see anything ``from a legal standpoint'' that suggests Solomon
is mentally ill. He also said he had concerns about Solomon's
safety and the safety of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon is accused of shooting six of his Heritage High School
classmates as they waited for classes to begin May 20. None of the
injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Schneider set an Aug. 9 hearing to consider
whether Solomon should remain in Juvenile Court or be sent to
Rockdale County Superior Court to stand trial as an adult.
