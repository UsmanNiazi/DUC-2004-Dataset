   Below is the text of the letter found under Anthony B. ``T.J.''
Solomon's bed, as read aloud in court Monday:
</P>
<P>
   No one could ever know how I feel. No one will ever know. Even
the smallest of scars can run the deepest. I've overcome a lot in
my few years. But I understand I'm still leaving a lot behind me
that I haven't even experienced yet. There aren't any words that I
can say to describe how I feel. The one big question everybody's
probably wondering about is why? Well for the sake of my brothers
and sisters related to the trenchcoat mafia, that will have to
remain a mystery to the public eye. I have been planning this for
years, but I finally got pissed off enough to really do it. This
mission has nothing to do with Hitler. It's not because I was
picked on. It goes further than that. I'm still not sure that
bombing the school is such a good idea. So I at least give you an
idea of what's going on. If the cops have been doing their jobs
correctly, you'll have found the sheets I printed out with the bomb
procedures on them. Four of those bombs, including three that are
not there, have been placed somewhere in or around Heritage High
School. All in all, there are maybe only 17, if that. Be very
careful. The drop of a safety pin could set at least six off (I've
tried that).
