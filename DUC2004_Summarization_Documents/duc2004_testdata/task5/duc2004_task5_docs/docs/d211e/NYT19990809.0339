   ROCKDALE COUNTY, Ga. _ Offering the first detailed look at the
case against Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon, Rockdale County prosecutors
said Monday the 15-year-old coldly planned his attack before he
entered the Heritage High School commons area and sprayed it with
bullets May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Their evidence:
</P>
<P>
   _ A handwritten note outlining plans for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   _ A printout of bomb-making instructions titled ``Bombs and
Deadly Ideas by 'T.J.' Solomon.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Testimony by fellow students that Solomon had vowed to do a
better job than Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the suicidal
attackers at Colorado's Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would even shoot me,'' testified Teeunia Stroud,
who said she was a friend of Solomon's.
</P>
<P>
   Hugging a .22-caliber sawed-off rifle at his hip, prosecutors
said, Solomon peppered the ammunition randomly into the crowd of
150 to 200 students, hitting six of them. He ran out the school
door, then pulled out a .357 handgun when he realized two of his
classmates were chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Brandon Mitchell, said Solomon fired a shot at him,
forcing Mitchell to jump into the bushes. Two other shots followed,
one into a classroom, the other's direction unknown.
</P>
<P>
   At the Juvenile Court hearing to determine whether Solomon
should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult, prosecutors revealed
the contents of a note found in Solomon's home after the attack.
The note says the motive for the attack ``will have to remain a
mystery'' and cautioned authorities to look for bombs at Heritage.
None were found.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will resume today.
