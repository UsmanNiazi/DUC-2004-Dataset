 &HT;    Teen accused of school shooting indicted

   ROCKDALE CO., Ga. _ A grand jury indicted Anthony ``T.J.''
Solomon on 29 felony counts Tuesday for the May 20 shooting and
wounding of six students at Heritage High School near Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who turned 16 Friday, next faces an Oct. 7 arraignment
in Superior Court. A juvenile court judge earlier ruled that
Solomon should be prosecuted as an adult, although his lawyers plan
to appeal that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charges returned by the grand jury _ aggravated
assault and cruelty to children _ carry maximum prison terms of 20
years upon conviction. Some of those sentences could run
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Several students and school officials have testified they saw
Solomon fire the .22-caliber rifle and .357-caliber revolver he
carried to school a month. His lawyers don't dispute those
accounts. In juvenile court, they focused on his mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the case will not discuss a possible plea agreement.
Plea negotiations are more likely in cases where eyewitness
testimony weighs so heavily against a defendant, said Seth
Kirschenbaum, a past chairman of the Atlanta Bar Association's
criminal law section.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's really a little early for the lawyers to be making
decisions about plea bargaining,'' Kirschenbaum said. ``As the case
goes on, with pretrial rulings, it will begin to crystallize.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, trials are scheduled about two months after indictment
in Rockdale. However, this case could be delayed as two veteran
defense lawyers, Ed Garland and Don Samuel, prepare pretrial
motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not the normal scheme of things,'' said District
Attorney Richard Read.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers did not return calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to charges that Solomon shot the six students, all
of whom survived, the Rockdale County grand jury added charges
referring to three other students who were not wounded. Two were
girls whose books were struck by bullets. One was a boy who had
been labeled a target, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also charged Solomon with carrying a weapon at
school, using a firearm while committing a crime and possession of
a pistol by someone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to Superior Court Judge Sidney Nation.
