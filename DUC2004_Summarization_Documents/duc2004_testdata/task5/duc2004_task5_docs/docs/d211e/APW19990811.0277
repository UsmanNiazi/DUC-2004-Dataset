	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A 15-year-old accused of wounding six of his  
high school classmates during a shooting spree has been ordered to 
stand trial as an adult by a judge who cited the ``severity and 
viciousness'' of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon came Wednesday, the  
same day students returned to Heritage High School after summer 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	In his decision, Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider noted  
that Solomon referred to the shooting at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo., in a note left under his bed. The Littleton 
shootings left 15 dead, including the two teen-age gunmen, and took 
place exactly one month before the shootings in this suburb 20 
miles east of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the child has attempted to copy a heinous and  
devastating crime through premeditation and deceit makes these 
actions even more egregious and outrageous demonstrations of 
disrespect for the safety and the well-being of our community,'' 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The severity and the viciousness of these offenses make the  
public's interest in treating the juvenile as an adult paramount to 
any other interests before the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had he been tried as a juvenile, Solomon would have faced up to  
five years of supervision, which could have included house arrest 
and probation. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all 21 counts he faces, he could be sent to  
prison for 351 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys planned to appeal the ruling to the Georgia  
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad when we take a sick, mentally ill young kid and throw  
him on the trash heap of the adult prison system,'' lawyer Ed 
Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his defense lawyers also said they would be open to a  
plea bargain. District Attorney Richard Read would not comment on 
such a deal, saying only ``there needs to be a sentence that is 
just and makes sense to everyone involved, including the 
community,'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Heritage High, Principal Lowell Biddy said the first day was  
``extremely smooth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had a normal day,'' Biddy said.
