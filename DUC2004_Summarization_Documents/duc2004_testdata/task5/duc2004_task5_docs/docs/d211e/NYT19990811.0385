 &HT;    Teen charged in school shootings to be tried as adult

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Citing ``an appalling disregard for the community,'' a
Rockdale County judge ruled Wednesday that Anthony ``T.J'' Solomon
should be tried as an adult for the May 20 shooting rampage at
Heritage High School.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider moved the case to
Superior Court, saying he does not believe the 15-year-old is
mentally ill, as Solomon's lawyers contend.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Rockdale shooting _ exactly one month after
the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., that
left 15 dead _ was not accidental, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the child has attempted to copy a heinous and
devastating crime through premeditation and deceit makes these
actions even more egregious,'' Schneider said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Six students were wounded at Heritage; all survived. Solomon
could face more than 350 years in jail if convicted of all 21
counts against him, which include aggravated assault, cruelty to
children and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager will remain at the Gwinnett Youth Detention Center
until after his trial. Even if convicted in Superior Court, Solomon
would remain in the juvenile prison system until he is 17. Solomon
sat with his head down for much of the two-hour hearing and
displayed no emotion when he was led out of the courtroom. His
stepfather, Robert Daniele, dropped his head into his hands, while
his mother, Mae Dean Daniele, huddled with attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, the boy's lead attorney, said he probably will
appeal the judge's ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. That
process could take at least three months. ``We disagree
respectfully with the court's decision,'' Garland said. ``It's bad
when we take a sick, mentally ill young kid and throw him on the
trash heap of the adult prison system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read, who repeatedly referred
to Solomon as a ``juvenile delinquent'' during the hearing, said he
will seek a grand jury indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the families of the six students injured in the May
20 shooting, who sat through three days of sometimes emotional
testimony, left the courtroom in silence, filing out quickly and
meeting in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cheek, father of senior Jason Cheek, who was shot twice,
said Solomon should get adult treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious from the evidence that this was a copycat on
Columbine,'' he said. ``We've got to stop this kind of thing. It's
torn our community apart. He needs to be accountable and the
message needs to be sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cheek still has a bullet in his pelvic area but is well
enough to return to the Heritage football team, where he is
expected to start at outside linebacker for a third consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Barnhardt, father of 11th-grader Brian Barnhardt, called
the ruling fair. ``The bottom line is the punishment should fit the
crime,'' he said. ``I feel for T.J.'s parents, but we could have
had six fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danieles, walking hurriedly from the courthouse, declined to
comment. Attorney Garland said, ``They are very, very sad. She is
grieving and has been grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they believe Solomon does suffer from
depression, but that it is not acute and that he demonstrated his
awareness of what he was about to do May 20 in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ A note he left under his bed about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bombmaking instructions he printed out.
</P>
<P>
   _ The two guns and extra ammunition he carried to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   _ His warning to two classmates as he entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a 'me' crime,'' Read said in closing arguments. ``It
was all about making me, T.J. Solomon, feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garland said the clues were too blatant to be the work of
someone in a healthy mental state. ``All the comments to the kids
at school was a cry for help unrecognized,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage students returned to school Wednesday, about eight
hours before Solomon was bound over to adult court. Their reaction
to the judge's decision was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Sawyer, 16, a junior, said, ``He should be tried as an
adult. There isn't any reason for a kid to go into a school to
start shooting. When you do that, you're an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Waters, a senior at the school, was not convinced. ``I
don't think that he should be punished as an adult, but he deserves
to be punished,'' said the 17-year-old, who had a class with
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   To seek an insanity verdict, legal experts say, Solomon's
lawyers would have to prove the minor was not able to differentiate
between right and wrong at the time of the shooting. People may
lose that ability if they are delusional, said Atlanta attorney
Brian Steel. An example would be a teen who opened fire at his
school believing that his friends were being held hostage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression does not deprive a person of the ability to
appreciate right from wrong,'' said Michael Welner, assistant
professor of psychiatry at New York University's School of Medicine
and an adjunct law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,
Penn. Welner said the fact that Solomon concealed his weapon and
left a letter saying he knew there would be consequences for his
actions indicates he was in touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible verdict is ``guilty but mentally ill.'' Anne
Emanuel, law professor at Georgia State University, said treatment
programs for such offenders have not been adequately funded, so the
treatment envisioned when the Legislature created the law allowing
such a verdict is not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Steel agreed. ``They're just treated like every other prisoner,
except they might be given medication,'' he said.
