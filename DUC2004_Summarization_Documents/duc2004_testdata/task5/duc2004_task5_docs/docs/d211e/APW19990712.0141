<HEADLINE> Ga. School Shooting Hearing Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A hearing to determine if the 15-year-old  
charged in the Heritage High School shootings should be tried as an 
adult was delayed today after his attorney asked that his client be 
hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing for Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon had been scheduled for  
Tuesday in Rockdale County Juvenile Court. It was put off until 
early August, but no definite date was set, said Lillian Sellers, a 
spokeswoman for Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, a sophomore at the school in the Atlanta suburb, is  
charged with 21 counts including aggravated assault, cruelty to 
children and weapons violations in the gunfire that wounded six of 
his classmates May 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Harris, a lawyer for the Atlanta firm that is representing  
Solomon, said today that the teen-ager ``suffers from long-term, 
untreated and major depression with psychotic features and has some 
degree of suicidal tendencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The request to have Solomon hospitalized was made late last  
week, and the defense lawyers plan to meet with Schneider on 
Tuesday to discuss it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon has been in juvenile detention since the shooting and  
``is not doing very well emotionally,'' Ms. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of Solomon's lawyers, Ed Garland, has previously said  
that at the time of the shooting the teen-ager was taking Ritalin, 
a drug often prescribed for children with attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened one month after the shootings at Columbine  
High School in Littleton, Colo., in which 15 people died, including 
the two shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Solomon do not include crimes that  
automatically would transfer the case to adult court. It will be up 
to the judge to decide whether to transfer it, as District Attorney 
Richard Read has said he wants, or keep it in the juvenile system. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted as an adult, Solomon faces a sentence of up to 351  
years. The maximum sentence he could receive in juvenile court is 
60 months in the youth prison system.
