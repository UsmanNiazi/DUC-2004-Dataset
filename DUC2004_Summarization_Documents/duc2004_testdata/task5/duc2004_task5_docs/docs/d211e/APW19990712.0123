<HEADLINE> Ga. Shooting Suspect Called Suicidal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lawyers for a 15-year-old boy accused of wounding  
six classmates during a shooting spree at his suburban school say 
he is suicidal and should be in a hospital rather than jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Solomon ``suffers from long-term, untreated and major  
depression with psychotic features and has some degree of suicidal 
tendencies,'' Jan Harris, one of Solomon's lawyers, said Monday in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the request is backed up by psychiatric evaluations  
done for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution opposes taking Solomon out of the juvenile  
detention center where he has been held since the May shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no need for it whatsoever based on our  
evaluations of the facts and circumstances,'' District Attorney 
Richard Read said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Read said he wanted his prosecution psychiatrists to examine  
Solomon's mental state before a decision is made on where the teen 
is held. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Juvenile Judge William Schneider on Monday delayed  
until August a hearing on whether Solomon should be tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, a sophomore at Heritage High School in Conyers, is  
accused of opening fire on schoolmates May 20 -- exactly a month 
after the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., 
that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with 21 counts, including aggravated assault,  
cruelty to children and weapons violations.
