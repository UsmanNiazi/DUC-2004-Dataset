 &HT;    School shooting suspect's hearing delayed

   ATLANTA _ The hearing to determine whether Heritage High School
shooting suspect Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon will stand trial as an
adult may begin about the time that his schoolmates are going back
to class.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rockdale Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider
agreed to postpone the hearing, which was supposed to begin this
morning, until early August. Solomon's attorneys asked for more
time for psychiatric tests on the 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the trial date back didn't sit well with Heritage High
Principal Lowell Biddy, who said he fears the hearing will dredge
up bad memories at a time when students should be focused on
academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is just so poor, especially for those students who
are involved,'' Biddy said. ``They should have considered what is
best for the majority of the kids. This will be such a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale students go back to school Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockdale school board Chairman Bill Malarney said the
judicial system can't work around schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to allow the judicial system to work, both for the
defense and the prosecutor,'' Malarney said. ``We should allow the
courts to do what they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Harris, a lawyer for the Atlanta firm representing Solomon,
said the teenager ``suffers from long-term, untreated and major
depression with psychotic features and has some degree of suicidal
tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read said he had wrapped up
interviews with witnesses last week and expects to call a few of
them at the hearing. Solomon is accused of shooting six of his
classmates on May 20 as they sat in the school's commons area
waiting for classes to begin. He faces 21 charges of aggravated
assault, cruelty to children and weapon possession. None of the
injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is the second since the shooting. Originally scheduled
for June 1, the hearing was continued to allow Solomon to undergo a
state-ordered psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
   If Solomon were convicted on all counts as a juvenile, he would
spend 18 months to five years in a youth development center. If
tried as an adult, he would face sentences totaling up to about 400
years, although some sentences might run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington canceled his
participation in a summit this week on school violence in
Washington so he could attend the Solomon hearing. Representatives
from schools across the country that have been the site of
shootings, including Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
will meet through Thursday at the FBI's Center for Analysis of
Violent Crime in Leesburg, Va. They plan to profile the suspects
and determine similarities in their backgrounds, rampages and
motivation.
