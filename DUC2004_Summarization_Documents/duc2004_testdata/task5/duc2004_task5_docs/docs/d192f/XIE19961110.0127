NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, widow of
former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, has conveyed to some Congress
Party leaders that she is willing to do "whatever possible" on her
part to help various factions of the party to unite and arrest the
party's decline and disintegration.
</P>
<P>
According to top Congress sources, Sonia is actively
considering the request made by Congress President Sitaram Kesri
to become a member of the Congress Working Committee( CWC), the
highest policy-making body of the party, and provide guidance to
the party.
</P>
<P>
Several CWC members and Congressmen from all over the country
have been urging Sonia Gandhi to provide guidance to the party in
some manner so that the Congress regains the confidence of the
people.

After Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, Sonia Gandhi was
persuaded by the Congress to succeed her husband to continue
leading the party as the chief, but she refused. Since then she
has not taken any active role in the party's work.

At the last CWC meeting held here on November 4, the question
of requesting Mrs. Gandhi to become a member of the CWC was
mentioned by some leaders and the party president announced that
he would pursue the matter.

Congress sources said that in response to Kesri's request and
that of other leaders, Mrs. Gandhi was inclined to do whatever
possible from her side.
