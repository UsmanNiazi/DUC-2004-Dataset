Election results signal Sonia Gandhi's political arrival

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Recent provincial election results have
inspired new hope among members of the 112-year-old Congress party
and trumpeted the arrival of Sonia Gandhi on India's political
landscape, party officials and analysts said.
	   After years of waning influence and dwindling votes, India's
main opposition party pulverized the ruling Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party in crucial provincial elections in three
states last week.
	   The BJP lost power in New Delhi state, where the federal capital
is located, and the western desert state of Rajasthan _ two
longtime BJP strongholds _ and retained power in the central Madhya
Pradesh state, despite projections of a BJP victory.
	   Congress leaders said it was a clear victory for Sonia Gandhi,
the Italian-born widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who is seen
by her admirers as India's prime minister-in-waiting.
	   ``She has certainly made a good start, considering the doubts
there were earlier,'' said B. G. Verghese of New Delhi's
independent Center for Policy Research. ``She has matured, she is a
much more confident leader ... with greater acceptability within
the party and greater credibility outside.''
	   Though the state balloting had no direct effect on the BJP's
hold on federal power, the results will weaken its standing _ and
its hold over its 19 coalition partners. Gandhi, though, has said
she would not make an immediate bid for power by pressing for a
parliamentary confidence vote.
	   Gandhi, who married into what was once India's most powerful
political family, is the first non-Indian since independence 50
years ago to lead the Congress. The party was founded in 1885 by a
British man.
	   Between her late husband, his mother, Indira Gandhi, and her
father, Jawaharlal Nehru, the dynasty led India for nearly four
decades of its 50 years since independence.
	   The BJP had shrugged off the influence of the 51-year-old Sonia
Gandhi when she stepped into politics early this year, dismissing
her as a ``foreigner.'' Sonia Gandhi is now an Indian citizen.
	   ``It's wrong to say she is formidable,'' said K.R. Malkani, a
BJP vice-president, told The Associated Press. He said the BJP lost
because of its own weaknesses, not Congress's strengths.
	   ``The way the government failed to control prices, the way
infighting went on in the party _ I think that's more responsible
for the defeat,'' he said.
	   Thousands of voters heard Sonia Gandhi campaign last month and
during the federal election earlier this year. She slowly read
speeches in Hindi, India's national language, written in Roman
script.
	   She wears a traditional Indian sari, draping the end over the
head as tradition-minded women do to show respect for their elders.
	   During the campaign, she targeted rises in the price of several
food grains and vegetables, and the BJP's attempt to inject its
Hindu nationalist thought into the country's education system.
