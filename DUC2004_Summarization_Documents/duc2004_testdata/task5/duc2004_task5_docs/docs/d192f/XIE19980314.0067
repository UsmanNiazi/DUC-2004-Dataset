NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The following is a profile of
new Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who was appointed by the
Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body
of the party, here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi was born in an obscure Italian town of Ovassanjo
on December 9, 1946. Married to India's best known family of
Nehru-Gandhi in 1968, the 52-year-old widow of assassinated former
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi became a primary member of the
Congress two years ago.
</P>
<P>
After a tortuous suspense, Sonia finally decided to campaign
for the Congress in the just concluded general elections to the
12th Lower House of Parliament and is credited by observers with
preventing a rout for the 113-year-old party. The Congress managed
a tally of 141 seats alone, largely due to her charismatic
presence during the election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Sonia, whose Italian origin gave her opponents propaganda
grist, became an Indian citizen in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Sonia met Rajiv Gandhi in Cambridge, Britain during the 1960s'
when Rajiv was studying at the famous British university. Sonia
and Rajiv became extremely fond of each other.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the top job of the Congress organization was offered
to her on a platter immediately after the death of her husband on
May 21, 1991, but she declined the offer.
