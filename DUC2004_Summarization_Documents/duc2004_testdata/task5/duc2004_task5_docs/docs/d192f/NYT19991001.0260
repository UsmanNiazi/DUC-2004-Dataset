   RAMPUR, India _ Maneka Gandhi is the other daughter-in-law, the
one who did not inherit the dynasty. And oh, how the irony grates
on her.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she is the one born in India, Sonia Gandhi in Italy.
She has been in politics for 20 years, Sonia for two. She is the
widow of Sanjay, the anointed son who was a natural wielder of
power and his mother's right-hand man. Sonia's husband was Rajiv,
an airline pilot, mild in disposition, disinclined to the hard
knocks of governance.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the irony. ``That's what's known as life,'' said Maneka,
who is used to pondering fate's unwanted intrusions. ``I was going
along smoothly and then life got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, life _ that meddlesome conniver _ was again up
to no good.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, both of the estranged daughters-in-law had come
to politic in Rampur, a small city 120 miles east of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, leader of the venerable Congress Party, arrived in a
helicopter, which alighted in a pasture where 40,000 wildly
cheering people awaited her.
</P>
<P>
   Maneka, the cabinet minister for welfare in the national
government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, came by car over
tedious, pot-holed roads. She then spoke before a modest and
restrained crowd of 1,000 at a street corner rally beside a mosque,
a shoe store and a beauty parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Maneka did not want to be here at all. India is
finishing five weeks of voting on Oct. 3. A political independent,
running for her fourth term in Parliament, she was merely helping
out a party ally from another district. Nationwide, the party seems
to doing quite well, though this was not the case in Rampur.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours after reaching town, Maneka concluded that this
race was a lost cause. Moreover, the local politicos struck her as
so many dolts; she was furious at them. Before her speech, they had
left her to wait in a shabby, ill-lighted hotel room. And it was
there, in an interview, that she opened the steam valve to what is
a notorious temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have no idea what they are doing,'' she
complained. ``They sit with their feet up, studying polls and
picking their toes. I am wasting my time here. These fools did not
announce me properly and now they tell me they are expecting 500 to
1,000 people. Ugh! I can draw 5,000 in one of my little villages.
Now they're saying the crowd will be smaller because Sonia was here
today. Sonia! Sonia! Sonia is no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, with whom she talks no more. Sonia, who has also survived
the dynasty's epidemic of tragedy. Sonia, the aloof woman who now
wants to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1982, the two daughters-in-law lived under the same
famous roof. ``They hated each other's guts from the word go,''
said the writer Khushwant Singh, who was a family friend. ``Their
husbands didn't like each other either.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the household was Indira Gandhi, then the prime
minister, a woman with a tempestuous political career, alternately
loved and loathed by the masses.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional Indian mother-in-law, she expected quiet deference
from her sons' wives. Sonia, raised in a conservative Roman
Catholic family near Turin, was appropriately dutiful, building a
life around her husband and their two children. She would often
cook her mother-in-law a soothing plate of pasta after a hectic
day.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Maneka, daughter of a Sikh army colonel, was brash
and opinionated. Once a petite model and an aspiring journalist,
she was less inclined to wrap herself in elegant saris and far more
eager to poke her nose into the family business: politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, now 52, may have been a rival for her mother-in-law's
affection, but Maneka, 43, never considered her an equal as a
thinker. ``Take it from me, there's nothing upstairs except
cooking,'' she said of her sister-in-law, breaking into a naughty
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   When the titters subsided, Maneka said she regretted sounding so
``nasty,'' but then she proceeded to get nastier. She likened Sonia
to a Barbie Doll and complained that the Congress Party hierarchy
had chosen her as their leader because she is ``totally nondoing
and harmless and somebody who won't get in the way of their own
individual ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They think any Gandhi can win for them,'' Maneka said, going
on to explain why she could never be that Gandhi: ``I am much too
independent a person and much too serious about what I do to be of
value as leadership material to the Congress Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gandhi name holds a regal sort of magic in India _ a tug at
the heart strings if not always a lure to the ballot box. Indeed,
during this election, one of the biggest stories has been the
emergence of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Sonia's 27-year-old daughter.
She has been stumping for her mother, and the crowds adore her.
Thousands wait along the sun-parched roads for a glimpse. News
accounts have her ``casting a spell'' wherever she goes, with her
eventual rise to prime minister ``a political inevitability waiting
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Gandhis' mystique is in sheer soap-operatic appeal.
Their saga is hard to top, what with the birth of a nation, three
wars, two assassinations and one fatal plane crash. Pages in
India's 52-year history pile up like leaves beneath the family
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the dynasty bears no blood kinship to the most
famous Gandhi of all, Mohandas K., better known as the Mahatma.
Rather, its progenitor is Jawaharlal Nehru, the moody and dynamic
man who was India's prime minister during its first 17 years.
Nehru's only child, Indira, married Feroze Gandhi, the son of a
shopkeeper, who brought to his bride a politically useful surname
if no distinguished pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Indira, once thought to be a malleable political figurehead,
turned out to be both reliably bright and occasionally ruthless.
She dominated Indian politics for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At her side was her younger son, Sanjay, who, while not a
tenacious student of self-knowledge, was a formidable political
enforcer. He was Indira's acknowledged political heir, but his
destiny turned fickle among the clouds on June 23, 1980. That
morning, as he pursued the risky hobby of stunt flying, his plane
failed to pull out of a dive.
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, Maneka was a widow with a 3-month-old son. Grief did
not bring her and Indira closer. ``Maneka was totally neglected,
and Rajiv and Sonia came to the center stage as Mrs. G.'s closest
confidantes,'' said Singh, the writer. ``Mrs. G. actually went out
of her way to belittle the girl. With Maneka in the room, she'd
give Sonia something of her father's _ a watch or a pen _ and say,
`I want only you to have this.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever went on between the young widow and her powerful
mother-in-law is undoubtedly a convolution of mutual hurts. Maneka
wanted to establish her own political career, and by most accounts,
Indira suspected disloyalty. In March 1982, she ordered Maneka out
of the house. Maneka, who had anticipated the eviction, made sure
the press was there to cover her forced departure.
</P>
<P>
   Both women went public with invective. At one point, Indira
vilified Maneka for her rudeness, snidely adding that the family
had accepted her even though she was from ``a different
background.'' To some, this has always seemed a slam at Maneka for
not being of the Brahman caste _ and regrettable proof that Sonia,
a white European girl from a middle-class family, rated higher on
Indira's measure of social status.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1984, Indira was murdered by her security guards.
Sonia sat beside the bullet-ridden body on the trip to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That same day Rajiv Gandhi _ the reticent son who had preferred
to stay out of politics _ was sworn in as prime minister. Sonia,
fearing for her husband's life, had begged him not to accept. Her
trepidation was warranted. He too was assassinated, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, so long dependent on the dynasty, suddenly
found itself out of Gandhis. Sonia declined to get involved.
Maneka, the renegade, had drifted further astray: She now had her
own political identity as a champion of the environment and an
animal rights advocate. And she had already served in the Cabinet
of an opposition government.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1990s, the Congress Party has had its ups and downs.
During one descent, in 1998, things seemed to be in free fall.
Beseeched repeatedly, Sonia finally agreed to campaign for the
party, and later the hesitant widow became its president.
</P>
<P>
   Her primary opponent is the incumbent, the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, whose candidates often stress Sonia's
foreign birth. Some of it is simple mockery. One leaflet wrongly
claims that she forced Rajiv to convert to Christianity and change
his name to Roberto.
</P>
<P>
   As a campaigner, Sonia is much improved from a year ago, reading
her Hindi speeches with barely a hint of an Italian accent. Still,
with polls showing Congress behind, many party workers are ready
for ``The Gandhis: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing _ or appalling _ how so many around here believe
Priyanka can revive the party,'' said one Congress official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``It's clear that we're a
family concern, and the leadership will pass from Sonia to
Priyanka, and she will be more acceptable to the Indian public
because she is more Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   All three members of the dynasty's younger generation have been
out on the hustings. Besides Priyanka there is her brother Rahul,
29, a securities broker who lives in London, and Feroze Varun, a
19-year-old student who is Maneka's son.
</P>
<P>
   None of these up-and-coming Gandhis have declared an interest in
public office. In fact Priyanka, a former kindergarten teacher who
is married to a jewelry exporter, said she is decidedly cynical
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just dealing with people and getting the work done,
that would be fine,'' she said. ``But the manipulation process _ I
can do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Restraint is one of Priyanka's traits. In an interview, she
would not excoriate Maneka, saying that people are entitled to
their own opinions, no matter how unflattering, and that ``my aunt
ceased to be my aunt in 1981.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She obviously has a lot of anger inside her,'' Priyanka added.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign goes on, Priyanka is repeatedly likened in
appearance and mannerisms to her grandmother Indira. In her
professed aversion to the family business, she is more like her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Only Maneka seems at ease in the fray. She finds the fuss made
over Priyanka's future as ludicrous as the idea of the wrong
daughter-in-law ending up atop the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Life, forever haywire, seems to be getting in the way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priyanka, that's another one!'' Maneka said acidly. ``Here's
someone who has made no particular contribution to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused to harrumph, then finished her thought, ``And now
they want this little child to take over.''
