<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi Could Be New India PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- For years, Sonia Gandhi disdained  
politics and hid from public view. 
</P>
<P>
	When her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated in 1984,  
she pleaded with her husband, Rajiv, against taking his mother's 
place as prime minister. When her husband was killed in 1991, she 
went into seclusion, shunning the politicians who begged her to 
lead them. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she reluctantly emerged from the shadows to accept the  
inheritance of India's foremost political dynasty a year ago, when 
the venerable Congress Party reached its lowest point. Now, the 
Italian-born widow may be India's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost a vote of  
confidence in parliament by one vote and resigned. His fall was 
precipitated by the defection of his biggest coalition ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress Party, which the Gandhi family has dominated since  
Indira's father, Jawaharlal Nehru, led it in the 1930s, is likely 
to form the next government. If it cannot, an election will be held 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Gandhi did not initiate the government's downfall,  
she engineered the final blow. Indian newspapers said her personal 
lobbying on the telephone Friday night turned key votes against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	For the enigmatic Mrs. Gandhi, it was a rare foray beyond her  
immediate circle. She is considered a strategist who lets her 
lieutenants carry out decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still a political novice who has never held an elected office,  
she rarely speaks in public and does not hold news conferences or 
give lengthy interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi's campaigning before the 1998 elections was credited  
with rescuing the fast-declining, century-old party from oblivion. 
After the election, she agreed to become the party's president and 
focused on rebuilding it after years of scandal and ineffective 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is an intensely private person, Indians have always  
been fascinated by Mrs. Gandhi. Her face is a favorite for magazine 
covers. Even during her years of silence, every private meeting, 
smile or nod was dissected by the Indian press, which speculated on 
who was in favor and who was out. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting dignitaries routinely called on her at her home, as if  
she were an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
	If she becomes prime minister, her Italian origin will come  
under greater scrutiny. During the three-day confidence debate, one 
speaker ignited a shoving match when he referred to Mrs. Gandhi as 
``a foreigner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anand Mohan, an opposition member who crossed sides to vote for  
the government, told reporters, ``A foreign national cannot be 
accepted as the prime minister. If I had to choose between Vajpayee 
and Sonia Gandhi, I would choose Vajpayee a thousand times.'' He 
noted that Mrs. Gandhi was married many years before adopting 
Indian citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Although born a Roman Catholic, she shows public reverence for  
Hinduism, India's predominant religion. She wears saris and speaks 
a rough, accented Hindi. Her daughter Priyanka, 27, helps draft 
many of her speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, who is 51, met her husband when she was an  
18-year-old student at Cambridge in London, the first time she was 
away from her native Italy. During most of their courtship, she did 
not know he was the son of India's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite doubts many have about a foreign-born leader, Mrs.  
Gandhi has won many hearts by embracing the essence of Indian 
lifestyle. For traditional Indians, that means becoming a loyal 
daughter-in-law and member of her husband's family. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was closer to Indira Gandhi than Sonia. When the prime  
minister was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984, it was 
Sonia who cradled the head of the dying woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother-in-law had been the center of our universe ... the  
pivot of our lives,'' Sonia Gandhi later wrote in a book. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Congress Party turned to Rajiv, then a pilot for  
Indian Airlines, to take the leadership of the party, she begged 
him not to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pleaded with him, with others around him, too. He would be  
killed as well,'' she wrote in a book dedicated to her late 
husband. ``He held my hands, hugged me, tried to soothe my 
desperation. He had no choice, he said. He would be killed 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rajiv Gandhi served a full five-year term, but lost the 1989  
election when his name was linked to a payoff scandal in a huge 
arms deal. He was killed during a campaign appearance in south 
India by a woman who detonated explosives attached to her body.
