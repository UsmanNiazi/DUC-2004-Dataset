AN ITALIAN GANDHI IS CHALLENGED BY THE INDIAN PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY

   NEW DELHI, India _ Immediately and deliciously billed as ``Sonia
versus Sushma,'' some first-rate political sport lies ahead in
India between the videshi bahu and the swadeshi beti: the
foreign-born daughter-in-law (who speaks heavily accented Hindi)
and the home-grown daughter (who wears vermilion powder in her
hair).
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Gandhi _ the Italian heiress to an Indian political
dynasty _ is leading her Congress Party into a month of staggered
elections that begin on Sept. 5. If Congress achieves a majority in
Parliament, she is the party's presumed choice for prime minister _
that is, if she has first won herself a seat in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In India, any candidate may run anywhere in the nation, so there
was great speculation about where Mrs. Gandhi would attempt her
maiden quest for elected office. On Wednesday, after a series of
political jukes and feints, she showed up about 1,100 miles from
New Delhi, filing her papers in Bellary, a Congress-friendly South
Indian district where the party has never lost the seat.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Gandhi succeeded in keeping her plans secret from the
press, she failed to outfox those she most needed to fool, her
opponents in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Sushma Swaraj, a former
chief minister of New Delhi who has one of the party's most
viperous tongues, was tipped off and arrived in Bellary 10 minutes
after Mrs. Gandhi to run for the very same seat.
</P>
<P>
   Just as her adversaries intended, Mrs. Gandhi _ the
daughter-in-law of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the
widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi _ was not only left
with egg on her face but a little pasta as well. Mrs. Swaraj went
right to work on the fact of her rival's foreign birth. ``I have
come here to fight for India's self-pride,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she continued the attack. ``As a videshi bahu, a
foreign-born daughter-in-law, Mrs. Gandhi is entitled to our love,
respect and security, but when that foreigner asks to be India's
prime minister just because she is one of her family's survivors,
this cannot be permitted,'' Mrs. Swaraj said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi quickly hedged her bet. Party members confirmed that
she would take advantage of a convenience in Indian law that allows
a candidate to run in two districts. Mrs. Gandhi will also be
competing in a northern state, Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race won't be an easy one either,'' said a political
analyst, Mahesh Rangarajan. ``She'll be up against Sanjay Singh, an
old associate of the Gandhis. He's formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Gandhi, 52, raised as a Catholic in a small Italian town
near Turin, became an Indian citizen in 1983, 15 years after she
married Rajiv Gandhi at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   As a daughter-in-law in India's most famous family, she sat at
the ringside of history. The view was horrifying. Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by her own security guards in 1984. Rajiv Gandhi, whom
she had begged not to enter politics, was blown apart by a suicide
bomber in 1991. Sonia Gandhi withdrew from public life.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 she agreed to hit the hustings for a floundering
Congress Party. She appeared before adoring crowds who considered
her a brave widow with a magic name. Dressed in saris, she read
short speeches with the Hindi words typed out in Roman script.
</P>
<P>
   While this adventure in barnstorming did not prevent the BJP
from coming to power, it did show that Sonia Gandhi was the
Congress Party's best _ and perhaps only _ hope for a comeback. She
became the party's president in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, Congress won impressive victories against
the BJP in state elections, and its revival seemed almost
inevitable. But last April, Mrs. Gandhi, whose political instincts
had earlier been marked by prudence, unwisely helped topple the BJP
government without Congress having the votes in Parliament to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   She then faced a rebellion within her own ranks as a few party
leaders questioned whether someone of foreign birth and scant
experience should be at the helm. Mrs. Gandhi resigned from the
party presidency, but then reconsidered after supporters pleaded
with her to stay and her detractors were expelled from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Now she finds herself in the midst of a short campaign season
with her Italian heritage being weighed against the Gandhi-family
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time in 14 years, she agreed to give
an in-depth interview, which will be televised Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   During the conversation, she insisted that she no longer feels
``one bit Italian.'' To the contrary, she said: ``I feel completely
Indian. I love India. I love the people here. India is in my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew that people find her Hindi hard to understand:
``Well, I do have this accent, and I don't blame people for making
fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sushma Swaraj is unlikely to accept these Indian bona fides.
``It's not hard to tell what this campaign is going to sound
like,'' said Jairam Ramesh, a Congress Party official. ``Sushma is
going to remind people that the button for India's nuclear weapons
is in the hands of the prime minister. She is going to ask, `Should
these hands be Italian?'''

   Years back, Indian politics was a marvel of simplicity: Congress
always won. Now, no single party seems able to command a majority
in Parliament. Coalitions have to rule and these involve dozens of
smaller, state parties who often refuse to allow ideology to
interfere with their horse trading. In every election, the matter
of who's who and what's what is routinely turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Gandhi's bloodlines
are one issue. Another is national defense. Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee's government has been enjoying resurgent popularity
since the Indian military bested hundreds of Pakistani-backed
soldiers in the remote mountains of Kashmir. Opinion polls are
predicting a decisive victory for Vajpayee and his BJP-led
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushma will know how to play up the defense angle,'' Ramesh
said. ``She is a great campaigner, full of life, full of
theatrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swaraj, 47, a lawyer and former socialist, joined the Hindu
nationalist BJP in 1984 and rose to become the party's first
spokeswoman. When the party came to power last year, she was named
information and broadcasting minister. She was frequently in high
dudgeon over low necklines, criticizing the sexual intimations of
modern TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushma is the Phyllis Schlafly of India,'' remarked Rajiv
Desai, who has created the advertising for Mrs. Gandhi's campaign.
``She is the quintessential traditional Indian woman with the large
bindi on her forehead and the red powder in her hair, and they've
picked her to stand out against Sonia Gandhi's foreignness.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, that comes with some risks. Polls show that a large
majority of voters say that Mrs. Gandhi's birthplace is not an
important factor in their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daughter-in-laws are very important to the Indian family, and
Sonia is regarded as having been a model daughter-in-law,'' said
Rangarajan, the political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a significant minority _ perhaps a quarter of all
voters _ do say the ``foreigner issue'' matters to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, this is India, and Mrs. Gandhi is Italian,'' said
another analyst Pan Chopra. ``When the pistol sounds, she starts
the race lugging quite a burden.''
