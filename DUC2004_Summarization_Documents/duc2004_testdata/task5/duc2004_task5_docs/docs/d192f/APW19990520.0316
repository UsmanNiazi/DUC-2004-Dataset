<HEADLINE> Gandhi Party Expels Three Leaders </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's Congress party expelled three  
politicians Thursday whose questioning over foreign-born Sonia 
Gandhi's right to become prime minister prompted her to quit as 
party president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that could cause a rift in the country's once-dominant  
party, Congress' highest decision-making body forced the three 
factional leaders out of the party for six years, spokesman Pranab 
Mukherjee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the prerogative of people to decide who will be prime  
minister,'' Mukherjee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi resigned as president of the Congress party Monday  
after the three suggested amending the constitution to allow only 
native-born Indian citizens to become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, who was born in Italy but has taken Indian  
citizenship, had been expected to be Congress' choice for prime 
minister if the party prevailed in parliamentary elections set for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi inherited the mantle of India's foremost political  
dynasty from her assassinated husband. Her mother-in-law was Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, who was also assassinated. Indira's father 
was India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the expelled politicians, Sharad Pawar, said he was  
relieved by the expulsion decision. ``I'll decide my strategy after 
speaking with others,'' he told reporters in the western city of 
Pune. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bombay, capital of the western state of Maharashtra that is  
Pawar's stronghold, his supporters said at least 80 percent of 
Congress party legislators in the state would quit Congress to join 
Pawar. 
</P>
<P>
	``A split is inevitable. We will form another party,'' said  
Chaggan Bhujbal, a Congress legislator and Pawar supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions of Pawar, Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar apparently  
did not have the support of all members of the decision-making 
Congress Working Committee. Mukherjee said the decision was made by 
a majority of the members, but he refused to say it was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Disciplinary action will be taken against party members who  
supported Pawar and the other dissidents, party officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her abrupt resignation, Mrs. Gandhi has retreated from  
public view and canceled appointments, including a planned 
pilgrimage Friday to the site in southern India where her husband, 
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	She has also resisted repeated entreaties by party bosses and  
rank-and-file supporters to retract her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has decided, to hell with everybody. Now she is citizen  
Sonia,'' said Rajiv Desai, a family friend and former media adviser 
to Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, the avenue facing Mrs. Gandhi's high-security mansion  
has been clogged with hundreds of supporters beating drums and 
shouting slogans, pleading with her to reconsider. One woman doused 
herself in oil and tried to burn herself Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds gathered again Thursday, and belted out pro-Gandhi  
songs. ``Bring back Sonia! Save the nation!'' the protesters 
chanted in Hindi rhyme.
