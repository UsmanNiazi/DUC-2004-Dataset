<HEADLINE> Gandhi Reflects on Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- In a speech meant to offer her vision of  
India in the new millennium, Sonia Gandhi recalled her party's 
glorious past today but gave few clues about how she would rule if 
elected prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi is being projected as the Congress  
party's candidate for prime minister in September-October 
elections. She took an active role in politics only last year, and 
has given only general policy statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the banner of ``India in the Third Millennium,'' she spoke  
to party members and the media, reiterating the Congress party's 
support for religious minorities and India's lower castes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party is committed to upholding the constitutional  
provisions safeguarding the rights of the minorities,'' Mrs. Gandhi 
said. She also said Congress would work to alleviate poverty in 
India's 700,000 villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi lifted campaign slogans from her late mother-in-law,  
Indira Gandhi, who was prime minister for 16 years and was popular 
for championing the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  
and heir to the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, which ruled India 
for 37 of the 52 years since independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress party cites the ``sacrifices'' made by the Gandhi  
family -- Mrs. Gandhi's husband was assassinated in 1991 while 
campaigning for office, and his mother was gunned down by her own 
bodyguards in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Sonia Gandhi's political inexperience and foreign  
birth make her unacceptable as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, she ineptly engineered the collapse of Prime  
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government without ensuring that 
she could cobble together an alternative coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress looked like a resurgent party with a good  
chance to win the elections, the news magazine Outlook said in this 
week's edition. But support seems to have dissipated, partly 
because of Mrs. Gandhi's mistakes. The weekly featured an 
unflattering caricature of her on the cover captioned, ``Ms. 
Clueless.''
