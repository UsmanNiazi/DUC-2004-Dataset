<HEADLINE> Profile: Sonia Gandhi, Dual Chief of India's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi has become the
dual chief of India's century-old Congress party following her
election as chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party on
Monday and her appointment as party president last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Born on December 9, 1946 into a family of modest means in a
village called Ovassanjo near Turin, Northwestern Italy, Sonia
Gandhi not only transcended continents and oceans but also covered
a political marathon and finally rose to the top posts of the
113-year-old Congress within months.
</P>
<P>
In the process, Sonia Gandhi emulated her husband,
mother-in-law and grandfather-father-in-law -- Rajiv, Indira and
Nehru -- who all held the two posts during their career.
</P>
<P>
Married into India's best known family of Nehru-Gandhi in 1968,
the 52-year-old Sonia Gandhi became a primary member of the
Congress less than a year ago before the Calcutta Congress Plenary
Session in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since Rajiv's assassination on May 21, 1991, Sonia had led a
life of near recluse for six years, keeping observers guessing
about whether she nursed political intentions at all.
</P>
<P>
During the period, fawning congressmen, looking for a
charismatic personality to lead the party to electoral success,
kept sending their appeals to her to come and take over the party.
</P>
<P>
After an excruciating spell of suspense, Sonia, who had long
remained something of an enigma to many, finally decided to
campaign for the Congress in the just-concluded Lok Sabha
elections and is credited with preventing a rout for the party.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, which was forecast not to cross the double digit
mark, managed a tally of 141 seats in the Lower House, largely due
to her charismatic presence during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the top job of the Congress was offered to her on a
platter immediately after the death of her husband, but a grieving
and reluctant Sonia declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
Sonia, whose Italian origin gave her opponents propaganda
grist, became a full-fledged Indian citizen in 1984 after the
death of Indira Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
Sonia met Rajiv Gandhi in Cambridge during 1960s when the
former Indian Prime Minister was studying at the famous British
university from where his grandfather Pandit Nehru too did his
graduation.
</P>
<P>
Rakov and Sonia were married in 1968 after three years of
courtship.
