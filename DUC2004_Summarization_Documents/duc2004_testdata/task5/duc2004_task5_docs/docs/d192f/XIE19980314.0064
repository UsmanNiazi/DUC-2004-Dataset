<HEADLINE> Writethru: Sonia Gandhi Appointed New Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Congress star campaign and
widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi Sonia Gandhi was
appointed new Congress president here Saturday to replace Sitaram
Kesri.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this, senior party leader Sharad Pawar said Sonia
Gandhi would preside over a meeting of the Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party,
convened here at 17:30 (local time) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In search of a charismatic and able leader, CWC in its meeting
on Saturday morning appointed Sonia Gandhi as new party president,
removing incumbent Sitaram Kesri, whose resignation was not
confirmed yet.
</P>
<P>
"To remove the confusion and state of uncertainty leading to
irreparable and immense harm to the party (in the wake of Kesri's
announcement on Monday to resign), the CWC resolves to appoint
Sonia Gandhi as the president of Indian National Congress in
exercise of its powers conferred in clause (j) of article 19 of
the party constitution with immediate effect," said a resolution
adopted at the CWC meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Kesri had resigned but the
announcement about the appointment of Sonia as the new president
was made by senior leaders of the party who held discussions with
Sonia midway through a meeting of the CWC.
</P>
<P>
The resolution took note of the special situation arising out
of Kesri's March 9 announcement that he had decided to resign in
favor of Sonia Gandhi. "After considering the special situation
since this announcement, CWC feels that the organizational work
had come to a standstill and that a hiatus had been created in the
smooth functioning of the party," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the top job of the Congress organization was offered
to Sonia Gandhi immediately after her husband and former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated during election campaign in
Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991, but she declined the offer. After
seven years of silence, she finally decided to campaign for the
Congress in the just concluded general elections to the 12th Lower
House of Parliament and is credited by observers with preventing a
rout for the 113-year-old party. The Congress, which was forecast
not to cross the double digit mark, managed a tally of 141 seats
alone out of 539 already elected MPs in the House, largely due to
her charismatic presence during the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Defiant incumbent Kesri refused to quit and termed her
appointment as "illegal". Addressing a press conference here
shortly after an emergency CWC meeting from which he walked out in
a midway, Kesri said that the CWC decision was "unconstitutional"
and that he would take the issue to the people's court. In the CWC
meeting earlier, Kesri was learnt to have reacted to the
suggestion to make way for Sonia Gandhi by saying "don't bring
pressure. I will do it in a dignified way". When asked about his
often repeated quote that he would make way for Sonia Gandhi to
take over as Congress president, he said he still stood by it but
would go out only in a dignified manner.
