<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, one of the great actors of the English stage
who enthralled audiences for more than 60 years with his eloquent
voice and consummate artistry, died Sunday at his home in
Aylesbury, west of London. He was 96 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last survivor of that triumvirate of legendary
theatrical knights _ Lord Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson
and Gielgud _ who dominated acting in England and vitalized
Shakespeare in what became a golden age of classical theater. He
was especially celebrated for his performances as Romeo, Hamlet,
Benedick, Angelo in ``Measure for Measure,'' Prospero and various
kings of the realm. With equal ease, he demonstrated his finesse in
plays by Wilde and Chekhov and by his contemporaries, who ranged
from Shaw to Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   A quintessential man of the theater, he was also known as a
director, a producer and an author. He loved acting and was devoted
to the stage, but he always understood the contradictions of his
profession. ``Acting is half shame, half glory,'' he once said.
``Shame at exhibiting yourself, glory when you can forget
yourself.'' And on another occasion he said: ``Acting has rid me of
my frustrations and satisfied many of my ambitions. It is more than
an occupation or a profession; for me it has been a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Olivier was known for his physical daring and Richardson
had a gift for eccentric characterization, it was Gielgud who
elevated language. In his bearing as well as his speech, he was the
most lyrical of the three, a fact that could lead people to
underrate his versatility. The beauty with which the actor
transmitted Shakespeare in his one-man show, ``Ages of Man,''
caused Kenneth Tynan to offer the backhanded compliment that he was
``the finest actor on earth from the neck up,'' leaving other
anatomical claims to Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   What the Tynan judgment overlooked was Gielgud the risk-taker,
especially in the last half of his distinguished career, in which
he revealed himself as a masterly character actor in plays by
Pinter and David Storey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke is that people think of me as an intellectual
actor,'' Gielgud said. ``Yet I have always trusted almost entirely
to observation, emotion and instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   He was ``the greatest classical actor of all time,'' Sheridan
Morley, Gielgud's authorized biographer, said Monday. Morley's
book, ``John G,'' is scheduled to be published early next year.
</P>
<P>
   An indefatigable worker, Gielgud acted until the very end of his
life. In his late 80s he appeared principally in films and on
television. His final performance on stage was in 1988 in Hugh
Whitemore's ``Best of Friends,'' in which he played Sir Sydney
Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of tributes published on Gielgud's 80th
birthday, Sir Alec Guinness said, ``John Gielgud did more to
liberate the English theater from the fustian attitudes of the '20s
and early '30s than any other man and paved the way for what is
best in London today.'' Guinness later wrote that Gielgud headed
the list of ``lasting influences on my professional life.'' In that
birthday book, Dame Peggy Ashcroft wrote about Gielgud that ``his
charm and his charisma have never flagged, and who knows what he
may have up his sleeve for us yet?'' He was one of the most
surprising of actors, and someone who could not resist a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his career, he achieved an even wider popularity for his
roles in films and won an Academy Award in 1981 as best supporting
actor for playing the butler in the Dudley Moore comedy ``Arthur.''
He was amused that people were surprised by his success in a comic
role. As he said, ``I always thought you must try to find the
comedy even in parts like Lear and Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vulgar dialogue he spoke in ``Arthur'' seemed to contradict
his courtliness. Tall, elegant and dignified, with an imperious
profile, he could quite easily strike a stance of snobbishness.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, his last major movie role was as Prospero in
``Prospero's Books,'' Peter Greenaway's 1991 version of ``The
Tempest,'' fulfilling a dream of his to perform that Shakespearean
role on film. That was the fifth time he played Prospero;
repeatedly he reinterpreted a character, returning again and again
to Romeo, Hamlet and other roles. His fifth King Lear was in a 1994
radio production, directed by Kenneth Branagh.

<P>
   In one magnificent season early in his career he alternated with
Olivier in the roles of Romeo and Mercutio; he received more
admiring reviews for his Romeo, Olivier for his Mercutio. In the
course of his long life in the theater he played almost all the
great Shakespearean characters, in a number of cases affixing an
enduring imprint.

<P>
   For someone who was known for his brilliant articulation of
Shakespearean verse and for his graceful stage presence, as a young
actor he was dismissed for his artificiality and his physical
awkwardness. His first drama teacher, Constance Benson, burst out
laughing in the middle of a rehearsal and said he walked ``like a
cat with rickets.'' For the young Gielgud, acting became a project
of self-education and self-improvement. He was his own most
demanding critic. Within a few years of his debut, he had worked
his way to the very top of his profession, and remained there
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in London on April 14, 1904, the son of Frank
Gielgud, a stockbroker, and the former Kate Terry-Lewis. The name
Gielgud is Lithuanian, he said, ``not Scottish, as many people
imagine.'' He was christened Arthur John, but was always known as
John, or to friends, Johnnie. One of four children, he came from a
privileged background.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud had the lineage to be a great actor. His grandmother was
the actress Kate Terry, Ellen Terry was his great aunt, Edward
Gordon Craig was a cousin, and there were other actors and
theatrical managers in his family. His brother Val Gielgud was a
playwright, a novelist and a director. Besides their talent for the
theater, he said, the Gielguds and the Terrys shared ``the same
weakness: weak lachrymal glands.'' They were easy criers, something
that he was to use later to his advantage in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in emulation of Gordon Craig, he set his earliest sights
on being a set designer. As a child, he said, he ``developed a
passion for painting for back cloths and designs in pastels for my
toy theater.'' He later wrote, ``I was stage-struck, mad about the
theater.'' Although he never lost his interest in design, he was
soon caught up by the idea of being an actor.
