<P>
   Great Shakespearean actors are a breed unto themselves, in a
line stretching from hallowed founders such as Richard Burbage and
Will Kemp down to latter-day stars such as Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   But with the death of Sir John Gielgud at 96, a pivotal
generation has seen its final curtain. Gielgud died peacefully at
home Sunday near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire west of London, his
former agent, Laurence Evans, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody currently working in the theater will agree that his
death is the end of an era,'' Trevor Nunn, director of the Royal
National Theatre, told the Associated Press. ``As Shakespeare said,
`There's a great spirit gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like his peers Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, Gielgud
was a leader of the first group of actors to bring the Bard to
movies, radio and television, establishing that Shakespeare would
flourish in the modern media as he long had on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud was much more than a great Shakespearean, however.
Indeed, many will mourn not one of the century's great Hamlets but
rather the Oscar-winning dry comedian of the film ``Arthur''
(1981).
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 14, 1904, in London, Arthur John Gielgud was of
prestigious theatrical blood. His mother was the actress Kate
Terry, one of four noted sisters who starred on the Victorian stage
_ Ellen, Kate, Marion and Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his theatrical heritage, however, Gielgud hardly
resembled the stereotypical Shakespearean actor. Unlike his friend
and rival Olivier, whose towering stature, piercing eyes and
brooding good looks made him as natural a Hollywood leading man as
he was a stage icon, Gielgud was a tiny man who stood only a bit
over 5 feet tall. His spry bearing and elfin smile belied his
capacity for wrenching drama, as well as the one attribute he
shared with Olivier: an infinitely flexible voice that could be
winsome and cajoling one moment, thundering and commanding the
next.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, the whimsical Gielgud loved to repeat his single
line in his stage debut _ at London's Old Vic in Shakespeare,
appropriately enough: ``Here is the number of the slaughter's
French,'' he said as an English soldier in a 1921 performance of
``Henry V.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an anything-but-ostentatious beginning, befitting an
actor who would never be either a heaven-storming thespian or a
spotlight-seeking celebrity. But it led to other roles, including
his first London hit, ``The Constant Nymph'' (1926), and star turns
in such classic English plays as ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' ``The School for Scandal'' and ``The Duchess of Malfi.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was to be for Shakespeare that he would become best
known. His major roles included a lyrical Macbeth, a thoughtful
Marc Antony and, in 1930, a Hamlet which one critic called ``the
high-water mark of English Shakespearean acting in our time.'' The
role became a specialty for Gielgud, who toured in it as late as
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s Gielgud was also an established director for the
English stage, showing versatility in handling not only Shakespeare
but also modern plays such as Tennessee Williams' ``The Glass
Menagerie'' (1948, starring Helen Hayes).
</P>
<P>
   American audiences first encountered Gielgud in films. In the
1940s he toured with ``Hamlet'' and ``Blithe Spirit,'' and in the
late 1950s and early 1960s became a semiregular on Broadway. He
earned a 1958 Best Actor Tony Award for ``Ages of Man,'' then in
1961 matched it with a Best Director Tony for ``Big Fish, Little
Fish.'' He returned again in 1964 as the director/star of Edward
Albee's ``Tiny Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud had made occasional films as early as ``Who Is the
Man?'' (1924), and had starred in Alfred Hitchcock's first big hit,
``Secret Agent'' (1936). However, he did not undertake a serious
film career until he played Cassius to Marlon Brando's Antony in
``Julius Caesar'' (1953). He, Olivier and Richardson appeared
together in ``Richard III'' (1955), and Gielgud subsequently worked
steadily in British and Hollywood films, earning a 1964 Oscar
nomination as King Louis VII of France in ``Becket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood never quite knew what to do with the diminutive,
quicksilver Gielgud, however, and he generally found himself cast
in supporting parts, often authority figures for which his regal
presence _ increasing notably as he aged _ lent itself naturally.
</P>
<P>
   It was in one such role, as the aristocratic valet to Dudley
Moore's drunken millionaire, that he won an Oscar for ``Arthur.''
Dryly sarcastic without ever seeming mean-spirited _ when the Moore
character announced that he was going to take a bath, Gielgud
responded, ``I shall alert the press'' _ the role suited him to a
``T.'' In fact, despite his character's having died in the first
movie, he reprised the role in ``Arthur 2'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's last major film role was as a surreal Prospero in
Peter Greenaway's controversial Shakespearean rhapsody,
``Prospero's Books'' (1991). In this highly offbeat riff on ``The
Tempest,'' studded with high-tech digital imagery, the 87-year-old
Gielgud spoke nearly every word of the two-hour-plus film. Reaction
to the film varied wildly, but Gielgud's performance was widely
praised.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews for ``Prospero's Books,'' Gielgud noted that ``The
Tempest'' is generally considered Shakespeare's final play, and he
seemed to think of the film as his own valedictory. Thereafter he
avoided large roles, though he remained active in a series of small
roles and cameos in films as diverse as ``Shining Through'' (1992,
as a cagy British diplomat), ``Shine'' (1996, as a subtle English
piano tutor) and ``Elizabeth'' (1998, as a conspiratorial pope). In
1996 he made a wordless micro-cameo as King Priam in Branagh's epic
``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud also appeared in a wide range of television projects,
including the PBS special ``Summer's Lease'' (1991), which won him
an Emmy Award. He may also have notched some kind of record for
publishing his autobiography over the longest span: ``Early
Stages'' appeared in 1939, while ``Backward Glances'' was published
exactly 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gielgud's greatest performances took place onstage, and
were not recorded for posterity. Despite widespread acclaim as one
of the greatest actors of his era, he lacked the ambitious drive of
Olivier and other contemporaries, often seeming more comfortable in
supporting roles than in commanding the stage himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his more than 75 years of performing, however, there may have
been no actor who was better liked. Though the theatrical trade is
notorious for insecurity and egotism, Gielgud _ who was knighted in
1953 _ won over practically everyone he worked with by his good
spirits, his charity toward others and his own courtly, unassuming
ways.
</P>
<P>
   So little did Gielgud seek the spotlight that when, in 1997, he
acknowledged offhandedly that he was gay, he was convincing when he
said that he had never mentioned it previously simply because he
had always thought either that it was already known or that nobody
would be particularly interested. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: THE ESSENTIAL GIELGUD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Gielgud did most of his best work on the British stage, and
very little of it was documented on tape or film. However, many of
his best films are available on video. A greatest-hits sampling
might include the following eight films:
</P>
<P>
   _ `THE SECRET AGENT' (1936).
</P>
<P>
   A rare look at a young Gielgud, age 32, as he and Madeleine
Carroll are secret agents posing as man and wife on a secret
mission to Switzerland. Offbeat early Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   _ `JULIUS CAESAR' (1953).
</P>
<P>
   A wild melange of styles somehow works out, as Gielgud's Cassius
and Brando's Antony play off a star-studded cast that also includes
James Mason (as Brutus), Greer Garson, Louis Calhern and Deborah
Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   _ `RICHARD III' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare as only the Brits could do it. Laurence Olivier,
director and star, heads a cast that also includes Gielgud, Ralph
Richardson, Claire Bloom and Cedric Hardwicke. Long (155 minutes)
and deliberately stagy, but well worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ `BECKET' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's delightfully hammy Louis VII of France steals the film
from Richard Burton as Thomas Becket and Peter O'Toole as Henry II.
Gielgud earned an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ `ARTHUR' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   As the sardonic, deadpan valet Hobson, an Oscar-winning Gielgud
enjoys perfect chemistry with dipso Dudley Moore and working-class
Liza Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   _ `WAGNER' (1983).
</P>
<P>
   It's Richard Burton's show in this five-hour condensation of a
nine-hour British miniseries, but Olivier, Gielgud and Richardson
reunite for a wonderful triple cameo as Vienna musical bigwigs.
</P>
<P>
   _ `THE SHOOTING PARTY' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud embodies British tradition as a guest at an English
mansion for a hunting party in the dying days of the British
Empire. Mason, as the host, is also gripping.
</P>
<P>
   _ `PROSPERO'S BOOKS' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's final leading role, director Peter Greenaway's
phantasmal multimedia meditation on Shakespeare's ``The Tempest''
proves that, at 87, the old British lion was still at the height of
his powers.
