   In the 1970s Gielgud took a sudden and exhilarating step into
modern theater, first with David Storey's ``Home'' (1970) and then
with Harold Pinter's ``No Man's Land'' (1975). In both plays, he
shared the stage with his old friend Richardson. The director Peter
Hall had expected him to choose the ``posh part of Hirst'' in ``No
Man's Land'' because it was similar to other roles he had played.
Surprisingly he chose Spooner, the seedy poet in sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both felt we were paddling dangerously in uncharted seas,''
Gielgud said, ``but our shared success (in ``Home'' and ``No Man's
Land'') was a lively encouragement as well as a refreshing
challenge after the more conventional ups and downs of our past
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Gielgud moved into experimental films, starring as a
tormented, aged novelist in Alain Resnais' ``Providence.'' With
that movie, he said, ``I felt I was in the avant-garde with a
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   The following decade, while acting on stage in ``Julius
Caesar,'' Julian Mitchell's ``Half-Life'' and other plays, he
expanded his opportunities in films and television. In addition to
his role in ``Arthur,'' he was featured in the films ``Chariots of
Fire,'' ``Gandhi,'' ``Shining Through'' and ``Power of One,'' and
on television in ``Brideshead Revisited,'' ``War and Remembrance''
and ``Summer's Lease.'' For the last show, he won an Emmy as best
actor in a mini-series. Together with Olivier and Richardson, he
appeared in the television mini-series ``Wagner.''

   Throughout his life, Gielgud was known for his faux pas, for
``dropping bricks'' in public. While having lunch with the
playwright Edward Knoblock, he said to his companion: ``Do you see
that man coming in? He's the biggest bore in London _ second only
to Edward Knoblock.'' Then realizing who was sitting next to him,
he retracted his statement: ``Not you, of course. I mean the other
Edward Knoblock.'' When he was directing Burton in ``Hamlet,'' he
went backstage after the performance and said, ``We'll go to dinner
when you're better,'' instead of ``when you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   His response to questions was candid. When the actor Michael
Hordern asked him for advice on how to play King Lear, Gielgud
famously replied, ``All I can tell you is to get a small Ophelia.''
Years later, he commented about Robert Stephens' Lear at
Stratford-on-Avon: ``He had somebody else carry her on!''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 24 years, Gielgud lived in a 17th-century house in
Buckinghamshire. With its beautiful garden and ornate furnishings,
the baronial estate was Gielgud's own Brideshead. The garden was
tended by his companion of many years, Martin Hensler, who died
last year. Gielgud has no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with the New York Times in 1993, the actor
was slender and stately, unbowed by his years. Anticipating his
90th birthday the following April, he had actively discouraged any
celebration. ``If I can manage to to go on working, it's much more
interesting,'' he said.

<P>
   In 1976, he had sold his home in London and moved to the country
_ and seldom returned to the city. ``Every street in London is full
of memory,'' he said. ``I've lost so many dear friends: Peggy,
Ralph, Olivier, Redgrave and, in America, Helen Hayes, Judith,
Lillian.'' Choking back his emotion, he added, ``Thank goodness
Alec Guinness is going strong.'' The poignancy was especially
resonant for someone like Gielgud, for whom the theater had been a
family.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth decade as an actor, he was still stagestruck, and
carried with him the history of the English theater in the century.
``I used to love being in the theater and having great actors come
to visit me.'' Although he did not often see plays anymore, he
resolutely read reviews and kept up with what was happening on
stage in London.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not working, he passed ``the time rather agreeably,
as long as one doesn't brood too much about death and the unhappy
things of one's life.'' He said: ``I get moments of great
depression. Fortunately, I've had very good friends who have been
critical of me. They haven't flattered me too much so that I
acquired a sense of my own importance. That's a danger for an
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a great reader, often finishing four books a week, and he
also watched television. For many years, his favorite shows were
``Cheers'' and ``Dynasty.'' Through the 1990s he never stopped
working, appearing on television and in 1998 in the film
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his interest in experimental theater, for years he had
avoided doing works by Samuel Beckett, and said that he had talked
Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness out of doing the original London
production of ``Waiting for Godot.'' In retrospect, he regretted
not doing ``Endgame,'' and this spring he acted for the last time,
in a film of Beckett's play ``Catastrophe,'' as ``the victim''
opposite Harold Pinter, under the direction of David Mamet. The
film is part of a series of movies made of all Beckett's stage
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's own writing was as elegant as his acting. His books
include the autobiographies ``Early Stages'' and ``An Actor and His
Time,'' and two collections of essays, ``Stage Directions'' and
``Distinguished Company.'' In ``Stage Directions'' he wrote, ``For
me the theater has always been an escape, a make-believe world,
full of color and excitement, fun, emotion, poetry and movement, a
world of striking characters and extraordinary personalities.'' One
of the most extraordinary was Gielgud himself.
