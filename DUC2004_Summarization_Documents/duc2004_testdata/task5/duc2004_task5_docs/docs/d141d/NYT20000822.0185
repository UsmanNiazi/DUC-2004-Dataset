CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN PANTHEON OF ACTORS, ONE ACTOR LESS FAMILIAR

   Who was the greatest actor in the English-speaking world? The
question arises with the death this year of two of the primary
candidates for that title, John Gielgud and Alec Guinness. Along
with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, they were the great
knights of the English theater.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Gielgud and Olivier were opposites, Gielgud with his
eloquent voice, an instrument for the ages (of man and of
Shakespeare), Olivier with his impassioned sense of the dramatic,
physical as well as emotional. The truth is somewhat reversible.
While Olivier customarily approached a role from the outside,
choosing a walk and a look _ specifically a false nose _ for his
character, Gielgud, the presumed intellectual, was more intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, it might be said that Richardson and Guinness had
similarities, especially in their gift for playing eccentric, often
comic characters. But in his transformations, Richardson retained a
glimmer of himself, so that one did not always know if he was
acting or being. Guinness abandoned all sense of self and was
totally immersed within a character and often unrecognizable from
one role to another.
</P>
<P>
   Within the quartet there was mutual admiration and, at least
between Olivier and Gielgud, an edge of rivalry. Guinness, as
self-effacing in print as he was in performance, wrote in his
autobiography, ``Blessings in Disguise,'' that he was well aware
that he was not in the same class as the ``greats.'' He added that
his ``pleasure is in putting little bits of things together, as if
playing with a jigsaw puzzle.'' Of the four, Guinness was the one
who had the most substantial and successful film career.
</P>
<P>
   All were marked by their daring and the surprise they could
bring to a performance, qualities that separate the talented from
the unforgettable, as was also true of Edith Evans and Peggy
Ashcroft. Among living actors, Michael Gambon, Anthony Hopkins and
Ian McKellen _ all of them knighted _ have demonstrated their
eligibility for that pantheon, as have Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and
Eileen Atkins. In the United States the contemporary candidates are
fewer, partly as a result of the limited access that American
actors have to classics.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Meyer, the translator and biographer who died recently,
was unequivocal in his choice, and it was none of the above. In his
memoir, ``Words Through a Windowpane,'' he said that the greatest
actor he had seen was Frederick Valk.
</P>
<P>
   Valk, he explained, was a German Jew who was firmly established
as an actor by the time Hitler came to power. In 1933 he moved to
Prague and became a leader of the German theater there. In 1939,
with only days to spare, he escaped from the Nazis and emigrated to
England. He had already played a diverse gallery of great classical
roles. With apparent ease he made the transition to the British
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In quick succession he triumphed in Shakespeare and Ibsen and
also proved to be a master of comedy. Valk had only a minor career
in movies, appearing in supporting roles and often playing prison
camp commandants. He died in 1956 at 61, just before he was
scheduled to make his Broadway debut in Peter Ustinov's ``Romanoff
and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest he came to the United States was to play Shylock for
Tyrone Guthrie at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario.
Guthrie considered him ``a genial, gentle giant,'' whose voice
matched his physique: ``a warm and velvety baritone with an upper
register of extraordinary brilliance and power.'' He said that
Valk's career was somewhat limited by his accent.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer made it clear that he was not alone in his critical
judgment and said that two of the most important British critics of
the 20th century, James Agate and Kenneth Tynan, shared his
enthusiasm. The excitement of watching Valk seemed to provoke
critics to soar into the linguistic stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   When Valk played Othello to Donald Wolfit's Iago, Agate wrote,
``If Valk is not a great Othello, and if the duel with Wolfit is
not magnificent throughout, then let me retire.'' After seeing the
same production, Tynan, then an undergraduate at Oxford, wrote, ``I
have lived through three hours on the red brink of a volcano, and
the crust of lava still crumbles at my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a professional critic, Tynan continued to extol Valk
and to have the color red on his mind when describing him.
Reviewing ``The Master Builder,'' he said that ``his Solness has
made his star blaze red across all this continent, and other lights
are tapers.'' He switched metaphors in mid-theme: ``He seemed an
Alp, and when he fell from his crazy tower, the very fall of the
House of Usher seemed like crackling match wood. Valk rules our
stages.'' He was, he said, ``the best actor in England.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography Guinness recalled Valk in Guinness'
adaptation of ``The Brothers Karamazov'' as ``a bull of a man,
simple and endearing.'' Meyer was most impressed by Valk's
``explosive power'' in Shakespeare. He added, ``No one, I think,
was quite prepared for the equal mastery which he then showed in
three Ibsen roles: Solness in `The Master Builder,' Pastor Manders
in `Ghosts' and John Gabriel Borkman. All three are deeply
inhibited men whose passion can find no satisfactory outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Meyer was having lunch with Richardson, several years
after he had given exceptional performances in ``Borkman'' and
``The Wild Duck.'' Richardson suddenly asked Meyer to name the
greatest actor he had seen. Meyer hesitated, out of deference to
the other man at the table. After a pause, Richardson said,
``Valk?'' And both men agreed.
