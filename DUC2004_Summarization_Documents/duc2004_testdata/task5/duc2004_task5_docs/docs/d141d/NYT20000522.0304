<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, one of the great actors of the English stage
who enthralled audiences for more than 70 years with his eloquent
voice and consummate artistry, died Sunday at his home in
Aylesbury, west of London. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last survivor of that triumvirate of legendary
theatrical knights _ Lord Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson
and Gielgud _ who dominated acting in England and vitalized
Shakespeare in what became a golden age of classical theater. He
was especially celebrated for his performances as Romeo, Hamlet,
Benedick, Angelo in ``Measure for Measure,'' Prospero and various
kings of the realm. With equal ease, he demonstrated his finesse in
plays by Wilde and Chekhov and by his contemporaries, who ranged
from Shaw to Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   A quintessential man of the theater, he was also known as a
director, a producer and an author. He loved acting and was devoted
to the stage, but he always understood the contradictions of his
profession. ``Acting is half shame, half glory,'' he once said.
``Shame at exhibiting yourself, glory when you can forget
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Olivier was known for his physical daring and Richardson
had a gift for eccentric characterization, it was Gielgud who
elevated language. In his bearing as well as his speech, he was the
most lyrical of the three.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``the greatest classical actor of all time,'' Sheridan
Morley, Gielgud's authorized biographer, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An indefatigable worker, Gielgud acted until the very end of his
life. In his late 80s he appeared principally in films and on
television. His final performance on stage was in 1988 in Hugh
Whitemore's ``Best of Friends,'' in which he played Sir Sydney
Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of tributes published on Gielgud's 80th
birthday, Sir Alec Guinness said, ``John Gielgud did more to
liberate the English theater from the fustian attitudes of the '20s
and early '30s than any other man and paved the way for what is
best in London today.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in his career, he achieved an even wider popularity for his
roles in films and won an Academy Award as best supporting actor
for playing the butler in the 1981 Dudley Moore comedy ``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, his last major movie role was as Prospero in
``Prospero's Books,'' Peter Greenaway's 1991 version of ``The
Tempest,'' fulfilling a dream of his to perform that Shakespearean
role on film. That was the fifth time he played Prospero;
repeatedly he reinterpreted a character, returning again and again
to Romeo, Hamlet and other roles. His fifth King Lear was in a 1994
radio production, directed by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in London on April 14, 1904, the son of Frank
Gielgud, a stockbroker, and the former Kate Terry-Lewis. The name
Gielgud is Lithuanian, he said, ``not Scottish, as many people
imagine.'' He was christened Arthur John, but was always known as
John, or to friends, Johnnie. One of four children, he came from a
privileged background.

   When he was 17, he made his professional debut, of sorts, as a
walk-on in an Old Vic production of ``Henry V.'' He played the
herald and had one line: ``Here is the number of the slaughter'd
French.'' As he later said, he made such a bad impression that when
he subsequently had walk-ons in ``King Lear'' and ``Peer Gynt'' he
was given no lines to speak.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At 19, he played his first Romeo (opposite Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies), and it was, he later wrote, a ``baptism by
fire.'' But within a year he was understudying Noel Coward in the
leading role in Coward's play ``The Vortex,'' and when the author
left the cast he replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet,'' which he played at the age of 25, was the first of
his plays to transfer to the West End. The English critic James
Agate said the Gielgud performance of Hamlet was ``the high water
mark of English Shakespearean acting in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he brought his ``Hamlet'' to Broadway, with Jessica
Tandy as his Ophelia. It ran for 132 performances, a record for
``Hamlet'' on Broadway, until broken by Richard Burton in 1964, in
a production directed by Gielgud.

</P>
<P>
   In his first film, the silent ``Who Is the Man?'' in 1925, he
played a dope fiend, a role originally performed onstage by Sarah
Bernhardt. For many years, his cinematic work was sporadic; the
high points were Shakespearean, as Clarence in Olivier's ``Richard
III,'' as Cassius in Joseph Mankiewicz's 1952 version of ``Julius
Caesar'' and as King Henry IV in Orson Welles' ``Chimes at
Midnight.'' But his stage career continued unabated during and
after World War II and covered a wide range of classics, as he
proved to be equally at home in Wilde and Chekhov, Sheridan and
Congreve.

</P>
<P>
   Through the next decades, he continued to direct as well as act,
with the emphasis on classics, although in 1965 he acted in Edward
Albee's ``Tiny Alice'' opposite Irene Worth, and several seasons
later he staged Albee's ``All Over'' on Broadway. In 1968 he played
the title role in the Peter Brook production of Seneca's
``Oedipus.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brook said: ``John is always in the present; he is modern in
his restless quest for truth and new meaning. He is also
traditional, for his passionate sense of quality comes from his
understanding of the past. He links two ages. He is unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Gielgud was known for his faux pas, for
``dropping bricks'' in public. While having lunch with the
playwright Edward Knoblock, he said to his companion: ``Do you see
that man coming in? He's the biggest bore in London _ second only
to Edward Knoblock.'' Then realizing who was sitting next to him,
he retracted his statement: ``Not you, of course. I mean the other
Edward Knoblock.'' When he was directing Burton in ``Hamlet,'' he
went backstage after the performance and said, ``We'll go to dinner
when you're better,'' instead of ``when you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 24 years, Gielgud lived in a 17th-century house in
Buckinghamshire. With its beautiful garden and ornate furnishings,
the baronial estate was Gielgud's own Brideshead. The garden was
tended by his companion of many years, Martin Hensler, who died
last year. Gielgud has no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with the New York Times in 1993, the actor
was slender and stately, unbowed by his years. Anticipating his
90th birthday the following April, he had actively discouraged any
celebration. ``If I can manage to to go on working, it's much more
interesting,'' he said.
