   The Smithsonian Institution in Washington last week canceled a
celebration of foie gras, a delicacy produced by the forced feeding
of ducks and geese, after protests from animal rights advocates,
including the actors Sir John Gielgud and Bea Arthur. A Smithsonian
spokesman said officials were worried that ``something untoward''
might happen at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has a very '90s feel, pitting the prosperously
indulgent and those who cater to them against often censorious
defenders of humankind's lesser brethren, edible and otherwise.
Let's look at quotations outlining the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The new popularity of foie gras in the
United States was noted last year by Forbes magazine, which said,
``Ten years ago, most Americans didn't know foie gras from a faux
pas.'' It profiled Michael Ginor, the food's top promoter: (END

</P>
<P>
   ``A delicacy once prized by the ancient Egyptians and Romans,
the force-fed foie gras (literally, fatty liver) has in France
achieved the kind of reverence usually reserved for Victor Hugo and
sex. But it was little known in the U.S. until Ginor, a beefy
34-year-old, began peddling it to fashionable restaurants in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ginor and his partner, Izzy Yanay, can't meet the demand
they've created. In eight years they have turned a bankrupt poultry
farm in Ferndale, N.Y., into Hudson Valley Foie Gras, a $9 million
(sales) company earning close to 22 percent pretax. Hudson Valley
virtually owns the U.S. market. Along with a small California
rival, Ginor is responsible for the 50,000 portions of fattened
liver served in the U.S. each week.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Ginor's stature (enhanced now by a punitive
tariff on French foie gras) was to be recognized at the Smithsonian
event Sept. 21. It was promoted in a mailing to members: (END

</P>
<P>
   ``In a mouth-watering evening, join Mr. Ginor and other
celebrated chefs for a discussion of the history, production and
ever-rising popularity of foie gras today. ...
</P>
<P>
   Following the talk, sample several small, specially prepared
foie gras hors d'oeuvres along with a glass of wine. ...''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But then came protests organized by People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, notably this letter to I.
Michael Heyman, the Smithsonian's head, from Sir John Gielgud, 95,
the Shakespearean actor perhaps best known in the United States for
his Oscar-winning role as valet to a soused Dudley Moore in the
comedy film ``Arthur'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Secretary Heymann,
</P>
<P>
   I am extremely distressed to learn from my friends at People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) that the Smithsonian
Associates are planning to host a seminar `celebrating' foie gras.
I would like to tell you of the horror taking place on many foie
gras farms today. The male ducks and geese on these farms are
restrained and have their bills forced open. A long metal pipe is
then roughly pushed down their throats. Finally, an air-driven pump
thrusts two to three pounds of corn mixture into their stomachs.
The ducks and geese endure this painful and distressing procedure
three times a day for four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the birds' livers expand to six to 12 times
their normal size, they can barely walk or stand, their bills
become deformed or broken, and they suffer damage to their pharynx
and esophagus. Sometimes the force of inserting the metal pipe can
rupture their necks. And a percentage die outright from burst
internal organs. ... Female hatchlings are usually simply thrown
away, smothered or ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory examination of these methods would make a decent
person shudder. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Gielgud's letter was followed by one from
Bea Arthur, who played the not-to-be-messed-with New York woman in
the 1970s television sitcom ``Maude'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a vegetarian, but the extent of suffering of the
birds in foie gras production would be shocking to any meat-eater.
</P>
<P>
   Foie gras production is illegal in England and some other
enlightened countries, and I have had the opportunity to meet with
British members of Parliament on this very issue. ...
</P>
<P>
   I now join Sir John Gielgud in urging you to cancel this
upcoming seminar in cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But Ginor defends the forced feeding of the
birds as the principal author of a glossy new book, ``Foie Gras: A
Passion'' (John A. Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1999). He writes: (END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   ``The methods used in producing foie gras have concerned people
since the 11th century, when Rashi, the French rabbi, stated that
the Jews would pay in the hereafter for making the fattened geese
suffer. Since that time, farmers have constantly refined their
techniques.''
