   LONDON (AP) -- Margaret Harris, a theater designer whose work
helped modernize staid, gilt-laden English theater in the 1930s,
died Wednesday. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Harris began attending theater as a teen-ager with her sister
and a friend. They sketched the actors they saw on stage, sending
the drawings to each theater. One sketch caught the eye of actor
John Gielgud, who suggested the trio design the costumes for a
production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' he planned to direct.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the name Motley, the three went on to design several
productions for Gielgud, including 1932's landmark ''Richard of
Bordeaux,'' ''The Merchant of Venice'' and ''Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris also worked on Broadway and in Hollywood, designing an
American production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' starring Laurence
Olivier and Vivien Leigh and working on the sets for the film
version of the musical ''Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II made Harris a member of the Order of the
British Empire in 1975. In 1997, she received a special Olivier
award, Britain's equivalent of Broadway's Tony.
Edward F. Toohey:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Edward F. Toohey, president of the
Philadelphia Council of the AFL-CIO from 1965 to 1992, died in his
sleep Saturday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey was the chief spokesman and power broker for organized
labor in the region for close to three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey's biggest battle may have been the 1973 city teachers'
strike, during which he threatened to call a general walkout by
industrial and public-service workers all over the city. The threat
helped end a six-week conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey was also a leading figure in Democratic politics, closely
allied with Mayors James H.J. Tate and Frank L. Rizzo in the 1960s
and 1970s. He finally left his post in 1992.
David Young:
</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Young, the chief executive officer of the
world's largest air tour operation, died Saturday of cancer. He was
58.
</P>
<P>
   Young made a career of turning struggling airlines into
profitable ventures.
</P>
<P>
   During his time with Scenic Airlines, Young led the effort to
merge the airline with the Eagle Canyon Airlines group and relocate
the operation to North Las Vegas. Today, Scenic flies 25,000
passengers a month between Las Vegas and Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon
National Park in Southern Utah and Monument Valley on the
Arizona-Utah border.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a fleet of 24 twin-engine turboprop planes and
about 380 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Scenic has led the industry push to develop quieter aircraft to
fly routes over the Grand Canyon in an effort not to disturb people
in the park.
