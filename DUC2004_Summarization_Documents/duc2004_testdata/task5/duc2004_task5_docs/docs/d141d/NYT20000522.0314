   Sir John Gielgud, who died Sunday at 96, came to define the
great British Shakespearean actor, along with his contemporaries
Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson. Sir John, though, possessed
the most musical voice and the least histrionic delivery.
Self-possessed and ever dignified, he brought a mellifluous
sophistication but affable lightness to his work, whether it was
Lear's fool or Arthur's butler.
</P>
<P>
   He died peacefully at home in Buckinghamshire, according to
Laurence Evans, his former agent. It seemed as if Sir John might go
on forever as, unlike Olivier, his acting lost little gravity as he
aged. Even in Peter Greenaway's avant-garde 1991 film, ``Prospero's
Books,'' he stayed calm and authoritative while everyone ran amok
around him. It was in those Shakespearean roles _ Prospero, Hamlet,
Lear, in particular _ that he made his legend. There is regrettably
little of his Shakespearean work on film or tape, although he does
play second fiddle to (and victim of) Olivier in the ``Richard
III'' film and appeared with Marlon Brando in the movie of ``Julius
Caesar.'' He admired Brando and tried to lure him to the English
theater, but Brando wouldn't bite.
</P>

   Sir John put many of his best Shakespearean roles together into
a one-man show, ``The Ages of Man.'' Incoming Huntington Theatre
Company artistic director Nicholas Martin said, ``I saw `The Ages
of Man' six times. I followed him around the country, because I had
never seen acting that good, and I'm not sure I have since. He made
poetry as real as the most naturalistic acting, that was the metier
in which he expressed himself. He found humor and reality that no
one else could find in the text. Kenneth Branagh said that he was
the greatest actor from the neck up, but it was all there in his
heart and throat. As he got older he made poetry of anything _ like
his performance in `Arthur,' (in which he played Dudley Moore's
butler). He was arguably the greatest English-speaking actor of the
century.''

   Sir John made his stage debut in 1921 as a herald in ``Henry V''
and made a name for himself four years later as Trofimov in
Chekhov's ``The Cherry Orchard.'' Among his acclaimed modern roles
were Harry in David Storey's ``Home'' and the poet Spooner in
Harold Pinter's ``No Man's Land'' in the 1970s. His last stage role
was Sir Sydney Cockerell in Hugh Whitemore's ``The Best of
Friends'' in 1989.

   Claire Bloom, who became a lifelong friend, said by telephone
from London on Monday that she first worked for him when she was 18
in ``The Lady's Not for Burning.'' (He was a director and producer
as well as an actor.) ``I don't think he was very keen on my
performance and thought he'd give me the sack . . . but he was very
warm and generous. When I played Cordelia, who only comes on at the
beginning and end, I would stand in the wings and just listen to
him as Lear. He had an aura and magnetism that was unmistakable
from his youth to the end and he could illuminate the text as if
you had never heard it before. As a young man he was physically
very beautiful with large blue eyes and an aquiline nose. I
appeared in `Ivanov' with him _ he had an extraordinary access to
emotion. He could cry at the same time, the same place every night
and it was absolutely genuine. It was a facility he had to be
deeply in touch with his emotions.''

   Veteran American Repertory Theatre actor Jeremy Geidt says he
was more influenced by Olivier and Guinness as a young British
actor at the Old Vic than by the more romantic Gielgud, but lists
Sir John ``as one of those actors you would walk across the street
to see even if he was in something bad.'' Geidt remembers ushering
him around Yale in the 1960s when he was appearing in a two-person
show with Irene Worth. ``He was incredibly modest and while he was
precise he was not pedantic.'' Asked if younger British and
American actors reacted against his style, Geidt said, ``In a way
he reacted against himself _ he knew that his voice and that high
emotional pitch could work against him and he was always trying to
find new ways. I think now if you hear some of the old recordings
they sound old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Gielgud summed up his career six years ago: ``I
managed to graduate from being a kind of romantic juvenile into an
adequate character actor.'' He was also known for being, as Martin
called him, ``an unwitting wit,'' i.e. for saying the first thing
that came into his head. He saw a friend at a wedding and warned,
``Don't go upstairs. The bride is hideous.'' After attending
Richard Burton's first Hamlet at the Old Vic, he said, ``I'll come
back and see it when you're better.''
