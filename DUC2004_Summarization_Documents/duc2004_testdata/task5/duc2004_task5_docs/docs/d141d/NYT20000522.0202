 UNDATED: an actor.

   His theatrical beginnings were inauspicious. At Hillside, his
preparatory school, he played the Mock Turtle in a production of
``Alice in Wonderland'' and sang, he said, ``with increasing volume
and shrillness in every verse.'' After attending Westminster
School, he rebelled against the idea of a university education and
decided to enter the theater, vowing that ``If I did not succeed
before I was 25, I would follow my parents' wishes, and work to
become an architect.''

   When he was 17, he made his professional debut, of sorts, as a
walk-on in an Old Vic production of ``Henry V.'' He played the
herald and had one line: ``Here is the number of the slaughter'd
French.'' As he later said, he made such a bad impression that when
he subsequently had walk-ons in ``King Lear'' and ``Peer Gynt'' he
was given no lines to speak. After three years at Lady Benson's
School, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he played his first Romeo (opposite Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies), and it was, he later wrote, a ``baptism by
fire.'' One critic, perhaps in anticipation of Tynan's remark, said
that ``Mr. Gielgud from the waist downward means absolutely
nothing.'' But within a year he was understudying Noel Coward in
the leading role in Coward's play ``The Vortex,'' and when the
author left the cast he replaced him. Later he was to credit Coward
with teaching him the art of timing.

   Soon he was playing Chekhov: Konstantin in ``The Seagull'' and
Baron Tusenbach in ``The Three Sisters.'' In 1926, he replaced
Coward again, this time in ``The Constant Nymph.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time his name was in lights was in 1928 in a farce
with Hermione Baddeley. It was, he said, ``an appalling concoction,
backed by the lady who had written it, called `Holding Out the
Apple.''' It was followed by two more disasters. For several years,
he said in his autobiography, ``Early Stages,'' he was on ``the
fringe of real success'' while in danger of being typecast as
``neurotic, rather hysterical young men.''

   He joined the Old Vic, where he played, in succession, Romeo,
Richard II, Oberon, Macbeth and Hamlet. It was in ``Richard II''
that he ``began to feel at last that I was finding my feet in
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet,'' which he played at the age of 25, was the first of
the plays to transfer to the West End, where it joined two other
``Hamlets'' on the boards. The English critic James Agate said the
Gielgud performance of Hamlet was ``the high water mark of English
Shakespearean acting in our time.'' In other words, he had
fulfilled his vow to his parents. It was Agate who called him ``Our
First Player.''

   In these plays, as John Mortimer recalled, the actor's ``voice
ensnared and enslaved'' the audience. ``No one had ever spoken
Shakespeare with such intelligence and understanding.'' He added,
``No one ever mentioned a cat with rickets again.''
</P>
<P>
   The following season, Gielgud returned to the Old Vic, where he
was joined by another young actor, Ralph Richardson. In their first
play together, he was Hotspur to the Richardson Prince Hal. On
opening night, he was surprised to hear Richardson whisper to him
on stage during the dueling scene: ``Now you hit me, cocky. Now I
hit you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Richardson recalled: ``I found his clothes extravagant, his
conversation flippant. I didn't like him. But when I played Caliban
to his Prospero, John said, `Would you care to run over your scene
with me.' I thought to myself, `Not much.' But we ran it through
and he gave me about 200 ideas as he usually does and I thought, by
God he knows something about this here play.''
</P>
<P>
   They quickly became fast friends and mutual admirers. ``I was
always rather amazed at him,'' Richardson said. ``A kind of
brilliant butterfly, while I was a very gloomy sort of boy.'''

   At the Old Vic, the young Gielgud played Sergius in ``Arms and
the Man,'' Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and, at the age of 26,
``King Lear.'' But it was as ``Richard of Bordeaux,'' in his own
production in 1933, that he became a West End star. As he said,
``Queues coiled like serpents round'' the theater, as he was
``photographed, painted, caricatured, interviewed'' and lionized.
These were heady Shakespearean days, as he, often in tandem with
Olivier and Richardson, tackled the weightiest of classics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he brought his ``Hamlet'' to Broadway, with Jessica
Tandy as his Ophelia. Again, there was another Hamlet in town:
Leslie Howard, and the two dueled for domination. The Gielgud
version ran for 132 performances, a record for ``Hamlet'' on
Broadway, until broken by Richard Burton in 1964, in a production
directed by Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   In his first film, the silent ``Who Is the Man?'' in 1925, he
played a dope fiend, a role originally performed onstage by Sarah
Bernhardt. That was, he said, ``the most ridiculous part I played
on screen.'' Then Alfred Hitchcock persuaded him to be in ``The
Secret Agent,'' by telling him it was ``another Hamlet part.'' To
his dismay, ``Peter Lorre pinched all the best lines.'' ``The
Secret Agent'' opened the year of his Broadway ``Hamlet,'' and it
did not augur a promising film career. For many years, his
cinematic work was sporadic; the high points were Shakespearean, as
Clarence in Olivier's ``Richard III,'' as Cassius in Joseph
Mankiewicz's 1952 version of ``Julius Caesar'' and as King Henry IV
in Orson Welles' ``Chimes at Midnight.'' But his stage career
continued unabated during and after World War II and covered a wide
range of classics, as he proved to be equally at home in Wilde and
Chekhov, Sheridan and Congreve.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States in 1947 with ``The Lady's Not
for Burning,'' directing a cast that included himself and Burton.
``The Ages of Man,'' his one-man collage of excerpts from
Shakespeare, was a tour de force that he played in London, on
Broadway and on tour. In 1950 in ``a fresh start in a glorious
season at Stratford,'' he played Angelo, Cassius, Benedick and
Lear. Five years later he returned to Lear and astonished audiences
in George Devine's production designed by Isamu Noguchi. He was
knighted in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Through the next decades, he continued to direct as well as act,
with the emphasis on classics, although in 1965 he acted in Edward
Albee's ``Tiny Alice'' opposite Irene Worth, and several seasons
later he staged Albee's ``All Over'' on Broadway. In 1968 he played
the title role in the Peter Brook production of Seneca's
``Oedipus.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brook said: ``John is always in the present; he is modern in
his restless quest for truth and new meaning. He is also
traditional, for his passionate sense of quality comes from his
understanding of the past. He links two ages. He is unique.''
