A POSITIVELY FINAL APPEARANCE 
By Alec Guinness 
Viking, 256 pp., $24.95  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness is as close to a chameleon as an actor can
get, as this perhaps unnecessary diary attests.
</P>
<P>
   The title suggests why the book seems a bit much. He published
his autobiography in 1986, then a later diary in 1995. Now comes
this surprisingly crotchety diary, written between 1996 and 1998.
He says this is definitely his ``swan song.'' So whatever happened
to the adage that a performer should leave the audience wanting
more?
</P>
<P>
   Guinness is at his best telling backstage/inside stories. He's
less attractive as a grumpy old man. He gives us a taste of both
here. He gets points for being literate and literary, qualities not
associated with most actors, although, with words like
``valetudinarianism'' and ``numbustious,'' he may go a tad too far.
And he's not too highbrow to avoid the lamentable cliche
``chattering classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The best anecdotes are the catty ones. Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor are staying at the same Paris hotel as Marlene
Dietrich. Dietrich overhears the couple complaining about fans
``swarming around the front door.'' Dietrich advises them: ``My
dear Richard, my dear Elizabeth, if you want to escape the crowds,
don't stay in the same hotel as me.'' In a more unsettling
anecdote, Guinness admonishes a 12-year-old boy who'd seen ``Star
Wars'' 100 times never to see it again. Stars complaining about
their fans aren't the martyrs they think they are.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his thoughts on Sir John Gielgud. Immersed in his
role as ``King Lear'' in World War II-ravaged London, Gielgud is
unable to fathom why audiences are ``falling off.'' Writes
Guinness: ``John's grasp of public events was always rather
tenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The author evokes a scene in a Piccadilly restaurant where
actors wait for first-night reviews in the early-morning editions
of the newspapers. The papers are distributed and read. There are
moans, yelps of delight, scoffing laughs. ``They've spelt my name
wrong!'' ``Well, you're lucky to be mentioned.'' ``I don't think
poor old Jack will consider himself lucky to be mentioned _ miscast
and in two minds about what to say next.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the churlish Guinness, railing at and about the
nonagenarian in an adjacent hotel room whose radio is too loud.
Perhaps Guinness, at 86, sees himself at that age but doesn't want
to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Most appalling is the actor's merriment upon learning of the
Duke of Wellington's response to a question about the most inane
remark he'd ever heard. During the Peninsular War, Wellington heard
a Portuguese general address his troops before a battle with the
words: ``Remember, men, you are Portuguese!'' Guinness finds it
necessary to protest that he's not racist and that on two visits to
Portugal he's found the people ``kind, helpful and even jolly.''
Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as unfortunate is the author's resentment at being listed
in the newspapers as the third-highest-paid British actor during a
year. But we've already read that Guinness and his wife live quite
well and comfortably with their cats in the countryside, reading,
going to the theater, and traveling. He's plainly not suffering.
</P>
<P>
   His carefully crafted ruminations on the late Diana, princess of
Wales, and Prime Minister Tony Blair and the British establishment
are not earthshaking, and his visits to doctors and hospitals seem
curiously anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   He's much better off sticking to discussions of the acting trade
and its vicissitudes. Here, in an exchange he has with Gielgud, the
two aging actors, although lifelong friends, are still not above
trying to upstage one another.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud kindly gives Guinness a huge, richly bound Italian
edition of ``Hamlet'' with colored illustrations by Henry Moore.
``I was going to leave it to you in my will,'' says Gielgud, ``but
as I seem to be still going strong, you may as well have it now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would you like me to leave it to in my will?'' asks
Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rather hoped you might leave it to Paul Scofield,'' Gielgud
says. ``That would be killing two birds with one stone. He's a lot
younger than you.''
