   Q: Whatever happened to Ruth McKenney and her sister, Eileen?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.W., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ruth McKenney Bransten, whose New Yorker short stories
inspired two film versions of ``My Sister Eileen'' and the play
``Wonderful Town,'' lived from 1911 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Bransten's stories were collected for the book
``My Sister Eileen,'' Eileen McKenney West died in a car accident
near El Centro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   West and her husband, the author Nathanael West, were killed in
a Dec. 22, 1940, crash while driving to the funeral of F. Scott
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Sister Eileen'' took a comic look at the lives of two Ohio
sisters who moved to New York City to seek fame _ Ruth as a writer
and Eileen as an actor. Bransten also wrote the books ``Industrial
Valley'' in 1939 and ``The McKenneys Carry On'' in 1940.

House, 1801 S. Prairie Ave., Chicago, IL 60616.

   Hamm, 26, was U.S. Soccer's female athlete of the year four
times in a row beginning in 1994. Since joining the national team
in 1987 at age 15, Hamm has scored more than 100 goals in
