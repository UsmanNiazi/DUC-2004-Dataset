NO `HAMMING' IT UP FOR AMERICAN SOCCER STAR

   AUSTIN, Texas _ They'll sit knee-deep in canned hams, armed with
hammers and draped Hamm T-shirts in a section of 120 Hamm
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Stephanie Hamm, parents of the face of American soccer,
left their South Austin home Friday for Pasadena, Calif. On
Saturday, they'll become a part of the largest women's sports event
in recent history _ the Women's World Cup soccer championship at
the Rose Bowl. And their daughter, Mariel Margaret Hamm, had a
major hand _ make that foot _ in making the World Cup a global
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bill and Stephanie Hamm have felt the glow of the media
spotlight that usually falls on their 27-year-old daughter, the
soccer icon better known as Mia.
</P>
<P>
   With the World Cup in the United States and the Americans cast
as favorites against China, much attention has been centered on all
that is the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Stephanie Hamm have received quite a few calls during
the three-week tournament and, in turn, have taken time to reflect
on Mia Hamm's journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since she started at 5 or 6, she played to win,''
Stephanie said Thursday afternoon, taking time from her work with
the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. Bill Hamm makes
the daily commute to Universal City for his job at Boeing
Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, more often than not, the young Mia Hamm played on
teams made up predominantly of boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would put her entire body and persona in the game,'' her
father said. ``It wasn't like win at all costs, but she didn't
consider the alternative of losing. If she had something to do with
it, if she could affect the outcome, then she would do whatever it
took.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm's still doing the same as the primary cog in a U.S.
team that's reached the Cup finals. The U.S. won the initial Cup in
1991 and is the defending Olympic champion, claiming the gold
before record crowds in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the '96 Games proved the catalyst for the current
Cup craze, dovetailing with Mia Hamm's emergence on the national
sports scene. Her scope is felt within the sport _ she was the
Women's Sports Foundation Athlete of the Year in '97 _ and outside
as well. People Magazine named Mia Hamm one of the 50 Most
Beautiful People the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally reserved, the well-spoken Mia Hamm handles the
notoriety smoothly. But she's still uncomfortable receiving the
lion's share of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wished that that weren't necessarily so,'' her mother
said. ``She's become the focal point, but I think she does honestly
wish that people would talk to everybody. And I think that's really
happened in this World Cup. I think the personalities of every one
of those women have come out and they're all great. You couldn't
ask for better friends for a daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cup, Mia Hamm's story has brought added attention to
another important facet of her life _ raising awareness and funding
for bone-marrow testing. Her older brother, Garrett, died two years
ago at age 28 after complications from a seemingly successful
bone-marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, a Thai-American orphan adopted by the Hamms when he was
8, lived most of his life with aplastic anemia, a rare blood
disorder. He served as his sister's athletic role model and he's
the reason she began playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm now serves on the board of The Marrow Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad that everyone can see all of her sides, not just
the soccer-playing side or giving good interviews after matches,''
her father said. ``Also the compassionate side with her
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 90,000 in the Rose Bowl for Saturday's match will be
120 Hamms, Dillons (Stephanie Hamm's maiden name) and friends.
That's four rows of 30 strong.
