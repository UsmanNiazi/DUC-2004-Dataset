NO `ME' IN MIA

<P>
   ``Hey, Mia?'' Aaron Heifetz, irrepressible media officer for the
US women's soccer team, is saying for maybe the 5,000th time.
Another camera, Mia. Another microphone, another tape recorder,
another notebook, another face asking you what it's like to be you.
Just one more _ until the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron's the bane of my life,'' Mia Hamm is saying, pushing him
playfully in the chest. ``His voice gives me a rash.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia-Mia-Mia-Mia-Mia. It sounds like the cast of ``Figaro''
warming up backstage at the Met. Who doesn't want five minutes of
her time for an interview, an autograph, an arm-around-her-shoulder
photo op?
</P>
<P>
   Hamm just got her own building at Nike headquarters in Oregon.
She has that anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better TV ad with fellow
Tar Heel Michael Jordan. She's the cover girl on the unisex US
soccer guide, celebrating another goal in her bent-knee,
open-mouthed, two-fisted style.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's just-off-the-press book (``Go for the Goal''),
co-authored with Heifetz, is available on Amazon.com. Her number
(9) is on the back of a million or two age-groupers. ``Is that
player here?'' middle-aged guys ask in hotel lobbies where the
national team stays. ``You know . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mariel Margaret Hamm, the world's best female soccer player.
She'll never admit to that, even though she's just set the global
record for goals (109 and counting), even though she's been
praised, damned, feared, tripped, grabbed, spiked, and elbowed by
everyone from the Chinese to the Norwegians since she was 15. I'm
still working on my game, Hamm will say. Maybe someday . . .
</P>
<P>
   So the Mia-mania stuff makes her uneasy. ``I don't look at it as
celebrity status,'' Hamm says. ``It's never been how our team's
looked at it, and it's never been how I've looked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Hamm is Jordan on this team. The Americans won a
world title when she was still a wonderchild. They are defending
Olympic champions. They have lost just eight matches in six years,
only two of them on home soil. Half a dozen of Hamm's teammates are
playing in their third World Cup. Eight have appeared in more than
100 international matches.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly (``The Queen of Caps'') has played in 179.
Michelle Akers, who scored the first goal for the first US team 14
years ago, still starts. Carla Overbeck played 3,547 consecutive
minutes, went and had a baby after the Olympics, and is back as
captain. Tiffeny Milbrett has scored a dozen goals this year, and
they still spell her name wrong in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   There's no ``me'' in Mia, she'll say, and no ``ham'' in Hamm.
It's not like she craves the spotlight, but she understands that
people have settled on one woman who symbolizes what women's soccer
has become.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm has the medals and the numbers. She's undeniably attractive
(People magazine named her one of its 50 Most Beautiful People in
1997). She's married (to Marine pilot Christian Corry). She's
disciplined, unselfish, modest, approachable. And she kicks butt.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is the most visible, most recognizable role model on a team
that takes its role modeling seriously. That's why she'll stick
around forever after matches and clinics, scribbling her name and
small-talking with the wide-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the kids get excited about spending time with
you,'' she says. ``They want to know if I get nervous before games,
if I ever feel that it's harder to get out there some days than
others, and what do I say to myself if I make mistakes,'' Hamm
says. ``We have very similar successes and mistakes as young
players do, and it helps them to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm grew up as a military brat, one of six children of a
ballerina and an Air Force colonel who was always hopscotching
among bases _ Alabama to California to Italy to Virginia to Texas
to Virginia to Italy. The only constant amid the packing and
unpacking was soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way for me to fit in when my Dad was restationed,''
Hamm says. ``I'm not a real extrovert, and I was usually in the
background. I wasn't the loud one, like, `Hi, my name's Mia.'
Sports was how I expressed myself. It was an easier way for me to
communicate with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's message dovetails with the World Cup's ``Watch Me Play''
slogan: I was you; you can be me. ``I think it's wonderful to see
all the kids out there screaming everyone's name,'' Hamm says.
``Because we didn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was a Title IX toddler, the first batch of American women
who could count on playing on a high-school varsity and earning a
college scholarship. But once they'd done that, they had no
international stars to pattern themselves after. They had to be the
pioneers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't even a US national team until 1985. There wasn't a
World Cup for females until 1991, and women's soccer wasn't added
to the Olympic program until Atlanta. So Hamm's heroes were all
male.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Argentina's) Diego Maradona, with his dribbling style,'' she
says. ``(Germany's) Lothar Matthaeus, because of how hard he
worked. He played with his heart on his sleeve. He left every ounce
of himself on the field. And (England's) Gary Lineker. Nothing
flashy, but he knew how to find the back of the net. He was a
cerebral player. It wasn't luck, what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm knew all about the men's game because she had played it as
a kid. Her adopted older brother Garrett, who died two years ago
after a bone-marrow transplant to fight a rare blood disease,
always brought her along to play alongside him in games with his
buddies. When Hamm played youth soccer, she played _ and starred _
on boys' teams.
</P>
<P>
   When the boys got older and stronger and began banging her
around, Hamm learned how to survive with craft and guile. By the
time she was 15, coach Anson Dorrance, who later recruited Hamm for
Carolina, put her on the women's national team, its youngest member
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of naive about what the level was,'' she recalls.
``But I wanted to be on the national team because I loved how hard
they compete. I loved the challenges they gave me every day.
Everything was exciting, everything was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was the intense kid with the ponytail who didn't realize
how good she really was _ or could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia,'' Dorrance told her, after she'd started two games in
China, ``you can become the best soccer player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   All Hamm wanted then was to be as good as Carin Gabarra, her
crazy-legged teammate. ``I learned so much from watching her, how
dynamic her touches were,'' Hamm says. ``She'd just spin people
around.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Hamm three years to score for the national team. And
though she started for the 1991 Cup squad and potted a couple of
goals, Hamm wasn't the star. Akers, who scored 10 goals and was
literally head-and-shoulders above her rivals, was. ``Michelle
exposed the game to the soccer world,'' says US coach Tony DiCicco.
``That's when they realized the women were here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Akers went down in the 1995 Cup opener, it was Hamm who
stepped up and had a hand in nine of the team's 15 goals and even
played keeper when Briana Scurry was ejected with the US out of
substitutes. After she set up both goals on a bum ankle in the
Olympic gold-medal match against China, Hamm suddenly was destined
for posterhood _ and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working out at a gym when the Pert shampoo ad came on
TV,'' she remembers. ``And I kinda hid. I was laughing, thinking, I
can't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm never bargained on being singled out from a team of
champions. ``Who would have thought I'd have my name on a
building?'' she marvels. And she never dreamed that she'd be going
mano-a-mano with Jordan in a Nike ad. ``He was great,'' she says.
``He made it very special for me. He didn't have to do it, but he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge _ as the drumroll has built toward Saturday's
World Cup opener against Denmark, which will be played in sold-out
Giants Stadium on live nationwide TV _ has been for Hamm to stay in
balance, to be both role model and teammate.
</P>
<P>
   So she's dutifully responded to the Mia-Mia-Mias because she
remembers a time when nobody knew there was a US women's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to do whatever it takes to put our sport out
there,'' Hamm says, ``especially around an event like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jordan, she is the larger-than-life symbol of her sport
right now, and she accepts that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's just me, it's a lot of us,'' Hamm says.
``But it says a lot about where women's soccer is and how far it's
come and the increasing potential for it still. It's exciting to
know that we can leave some happiness in someone's life just by
doing something that we love.''
