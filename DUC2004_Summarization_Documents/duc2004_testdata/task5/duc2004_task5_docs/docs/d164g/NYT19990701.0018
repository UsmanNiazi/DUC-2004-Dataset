   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 1:

   The American Women's World Cup soccer team has burst into
national prominence in the last several weeks, selling out stadiums
and drawing the largest audience in the history of women's team
athletics at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. They will face off
against Germany this evening in the quarterfinals outside
Washington, with millions of new fans hoping they advance to the
semifinal round.

   The success of this charismatic team heralds a new era for
women's sports. Even though the United States won the first Women's
World Cup in 1991, the team has only now gained a mass following.
When the American squad took the gold medal in the 1996 Olympic
Games, NBC aired a mere 10 minutes of highlights. But this year
ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 are jointly covering all of the World Cup, and
the ratings have not disappointed. As the American team swept
through the preliminary games, one broadcast on ESPN drew more
households than the cable channel's typical major league baseball
game.

   The players are a new breed of athletes, born and trained under
Title IX, the 1972 federal statute that bars sex discrimination in
education. The women on the soccer team and in the WNBA are
products of competitive college sports programs that did not exist
before the law. Girls can now dream of a professional career in
athletics, something that seemed unattainable even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup has also breathed a new freshness into a
sport that too often in international men's competition has been
marred by fan violence. In the women's tournament, sportsmanship
seems paramount and the grandstands are filled with exuberant fans.
The star American forward, Mia Hamm, reigns as the leading scorer
in international soccer history. Her photographs grace dozens of
young girls' Internet sites, where she is venerated as a hero. Hamm
even has a generous endorsement deal from Gatorade and appears in
an advertisement with Michael Jordan bearing the slogan ``Anything
you can do, I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   More must be done to create real equity between men's and
women's college athletics, and the prize money for the Women's
World Cup is a fraction of what the men would make. But the
unfolding competition holds the promise of what women in America
can achieve in sports. &QL;
