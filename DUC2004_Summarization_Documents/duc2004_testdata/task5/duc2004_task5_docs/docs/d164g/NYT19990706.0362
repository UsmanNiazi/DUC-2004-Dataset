   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Mia Hamm did the unthinkable Tuesday, she
took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Not from training, jogging around or joking with teammates, just
from the dozens of camera crews and journalists that have become
Mia's very own Paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   She's a national icon now, bigger than she ever imagined. She
never looked for celebrity status, commercials with Michael Jordan
or a Nike building with her picture on it _ it all just came.
</P>
<P>
   Why? She asks the same question's sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why all this happened to me,'' said Hamm earlier
this month. ``All I can say is that when I go out, I play as hard
as I can. I play with intensity, emotion and passion. I can't
change that, it's who I am. It's the only way I've known how to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that grabs the attention of some, if people enjoy it, then
that's great for this game and great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those around her, the rest of the U.S. women's national team,
are not that humble speaking of Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows she's the best in the world, but she won't admit
it,'' said defender Lorrie Fair. ``She'll always put it on our
team. She'll say, `oh, our team made me this way.' Well, yeah Mia,
but you're a big reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her status could hit epic proportions this weekend if the
Americans defeat China in the Women's World Cup final at the Rose
Bowl. Should Hamm score, her patented wide-mouthed, fist-pumping
celebration will hit every highlight reel from here to the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said it won't change
her at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has so many wonderful qualities,'' said DiCicco.
``One is how humble she is. In a day and age where athletes expect
accolades, Mia is the opposite. She always refers back to our team
accomplishing these things. It's sincere, it's not rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other wonderful qualities to Hamm, like the one
fellow striker Tiffeny Milbrett described, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about Mia,'' she said. ``Last night she asked
me if I wanted to get some Indian Food. I was just tired and said,
`don't worry about me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So she goes by herself and an hour later I get a knock on my
door and it's Mia. She brought me half of her dinner. It wasn't
that I was shocked, but it was just one of those kind and warm
gesture's. She didn't have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think above it all, you forget sometimes that behind this
superstar is just a kind, warm-hearted person. I think if anything,
that's what people should know about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me she's just a total prankster,'' said Tisha Venturini.
``She's a jokester, comedian, always making fun of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, she does this Scottish accent she learned from a
friend back in college. It's actually very good, you know, this
girl has these hidden talents people don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hamm's not dishing it out, however, her team is.
</P>
<P>
   She may be the biggest thing to hit women's sports since Mary
Lou or Billie Jean, but on this team, she's just one of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tease her and that's what makes her so appealing,''
said goalkeeper Briana Scurry. ``All the fame she's had hasn't gone
to her head, which allows us to have fun with her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I give her a hard time about that Pert commercial.
It didn't look anything like her. They put so much make-up on that
girl I couldn't recognize her. She's throwing her hair around,
tossing it all over, it just wasn't the Mia we know.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there's the practical jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rearrange her chair in the locker room all the time,'' said
Fair. ``When the media comes in, we'll put her chair way back in
the corner to get her away from us. We don't want to get trampled
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And the bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time we were on the bus to one of the stadiums and there
was a girl wearing Mia's jersey,'' said Cindy Parlow. ``She had
brown hair like Mia, kind of similar looking, and Carla (Overbeck)
start's banging on the window screaming Mia's name.
</P>
<P>
   `Hey look everyone it's Mia, everybody look. Mia, Mia, Mia.' And
Mia just laughs along with us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Hamm wants it. Any other way she would be just a big
fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want what's happening to ever change the way I treat
people,'' said Hamm. ``I've had a lot of people who have been very
helpful to me growing up, and I want to maintain the same
perspective that I had from when I started playing the sport to
when I leave it.''
