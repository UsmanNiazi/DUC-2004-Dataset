WELL-KNOWN AND WORN-OUT, MIA HAMM IS STILL STAR OF WORLD CUP SHOW  
(DW)

   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ It is safe to say that no one from the cast
of ``On the Waterfront'' had ever watched the women's national
soccer team practice until Karl Malden showed up Thursday, along
with about 2,000 members of The Sopranos, those adolescent warblers
who were in full-throated Mia mania.
</P>
<P>
   The players needed a police escort in and out of practice at
Pomona College, lest they be trampled by the Nickelodeon mob and
dragged into endless discussions about the corner-kick abilities of
Soccer Barbie. A trio of cops even escorted reporters from one end
of the field to the other, a sign either that the Women's World Cup
has begun to take itself too seriously or the crime rate in
Southern California is suddenly less threatening than Mayberry RFD.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the shrieking chorus, most people had come to see
Mia Hamm and to get her to sign her name to anything from a soccer
ball to a second mortgage. As much as she continues to protest,
``This World Cup is not about me,'' the more it becomes apparent
that, yes, it is about her.
</P>
<P>
   She is the name and face that everyone knows. It is her jersey
that the little girls wear. It is her lack of scoring in the last
three games that has everyone wondering whether the Americans are
capable of beating the surging Chinese on Saturday in the World Cup
final before 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' said Coach Tony DiCicco. ``I expect her to
be a big-time scoring threat in the final. I hope she gets a
couple.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Hamm was named as one of five Americans to the
all-tournament team. While that was a debatable selection, it's not
as if she has played poorly. But, clearly, she has not been able to
maintain the dominance of her first two matches, when she delivered
a goal and assist against both Denmark and Nigeria and fully
deserved to be called the world's greatest player.
</P>
<P>
   She continues to run hard, to track back on defense, to offer a
wicked serve on corner kicks, to threaten on free kicks and to
attract defenders, which in turn unleashes her free-range
teammates. It was a furious sprint by Hamm that caused Brazil to
drag her down in the penalty area in the semifinals, which led to a
penalty kick by Michelle Akers and the security of a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had an impact on every game,'' said assistant coach
Lauren Gregg. ``She's been one of our most consistent players the
whole tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but as the leading international scorer in the history of
the game with 111 goals, it is her primary job to put the ball into
the net. For three matches, while China's Sun Wen has been ringing
up the scoreboard as if it were a gas pump, Hamm has gone silent.
Against Brazil, Hamm seemed hesitant to challenge defenders one on
one. In the past, it was a sign that she was lacking confidence,
something that she has said needs to be remade every day, like a
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her confidence is not bothering her, DiCicco said. It's her
legs. After four games in 11 days, he said that Hamm had become
tired, and has been using this week to refill her tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the men's World Cup,'' DiCicco said. ``They
play two games in 11 days, maybe a third. We played four and flew
cross-country. With all the travel, I think the front-runners lost
their legs. If they don't have their legs, it's hard for them to go
at players. I don't think Mia's confidence is hurt. I think she's
ready to step into this final.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco would also like more frequent and accurate passes from
his midfielders to Hamm, so she can run onto balls with her
passing-gear speed, instead of having to dig passes out of the
corners as if she were playing hockey instead of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a better job of giving our frontrunners quality
balls,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering, however, that it may not be necessary
for Hamm to score for the Americans to beat China. This team has
the resourcefulness to obtain goals from numerous sources. DiCicco
said Thursday that he may start Shannon MacMillan for Cindy Parlow,
using her speed to kick-start the American attack. When the
Americans defeated China, 2-1, in April in Hershey, Pa., Hamm did
not score but she set up both goals with brilliant passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've done some really good things in this
tournament,'' Hamm said. ``Offensively, people say I haven't been
as consistent. But I thought the German game was one of my better
defensive games. I'm OK with the way things are going. I need to
stay positive and keep motivated for Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the only day she has been available to the media this
week. The lasting image of Hamm at this World Cup is of someone
constantly in her face. A defender. A reporter with a microphone or
notepad. An autograph seeker. Wherever she appears, she is
immediately surrounded, as if she has been caught bringing
contraband through customs.
</P>
<P>
   She has never been comfortable in the spotlight _ ``I think she
feels it takes away from her concentration,'' said Donna de Varona,
the chairwoman of the World Cup organizing committee _ and this
week Hamm has retreated even further. Perhaps it will re-energize
her. Perhaps she will do what Michelle Kwan did at the 1998 Winter
Olympics, become tentative and reluctant. She cannot afford to hold
anything back, Hamm said, for there is no game beyond Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play the World Cup in your country, it's quite
hard,'' said Jarl Torske, the assistant Norwegian coach. ``I've
thought about the immense pressure that girl must feel. The media
focus is that she has only scored two goals. But she has been a
vital part of the team with tremendous free kicks and vital runs. I
can't say I feel sorry for her, because she is a tough athlete, but
I feel with her.'' &QL;
