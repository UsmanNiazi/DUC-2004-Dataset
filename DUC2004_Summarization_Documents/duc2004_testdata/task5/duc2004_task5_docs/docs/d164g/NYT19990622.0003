   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Sure, 10-year-old Jessica Woodgrift has
a poster of the U.S. men's soccer team, but there's simply no room
on her bedroom wall _ or in her heart _ for anyone except her hero,
women's soccer superstar Mia Hamm. ``She's big ... all my soccer
team loves her,'' Jessica said Monday as she took a breather from
blocking goals during the Master's Soccer School camp at The
Master's College in Santa Clarita north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the ``I want to be like Mike'' theme of advertising based
on basketball great Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of girls across the country would rather be like Hamm,
27, the superstar athlete on the U.S. women's team, who broke the
international all-time goal-scoring record this spring and who has
become the darling of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup games
currently under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could meet (Hamm) I would tell her that she's probably
the best soccer player that ever set foot on this planet,'' said
Jessica, a Valencia resident who has played soccer since age 5.
``Then I would want her autograph and then I would be speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   On soccer fields all across the San Fernando Valley and
surrounding regions, girls raved about Hamm _ her kicking
techniques, her sportsmanship, her team spirit, her scoring the
first U.S. goal in the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Liliana Madrid of North Hollywood has played soccer for only two
years, but thanks to Hamm, she now dreams big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go the farthest I can go. I see myself on the USA
team like Mia,'' said Liliana, 13, one of six girls in the
52-member Aztecas Youth Soccer Group in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Liliana's room is plastered with five posters of Hamm, as well
as any newspaper clipping of Hamm she finds. When she channel-surfs
on television,Liliana always looks for Hamm, to pick up new
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``She encourages me. Instead of quitting soccer, seeing her
helps me to support myself _ that I (italics) can (end italics) do
it. That I can be her one day,'' saidLiliana, who plays forward on
her team.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup, which started Saturday and will end July
10, has catapulted Hamm onto a world stage, but she's been catching
the attention of soccer fans for some time now.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's string of achievements includes four NCAA championships
at the University of North Carolina, a 1991 World Cup title, and a
1996 Olympic gold medal. For five years in a row she has been named
U.S. Soccer Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, I think she's done a tremendous thing for
women's sports, period, and certainly for soccer,'' said Vic Fodor,
manager of the Valley United Stars club, an all-girl soccer team of
mainly ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``She presents herself real well and is such a great, great
athlete. I think the girls do look up to her,'' Fodor said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hamm, Fodor said, his players looked up to older siblings
or friends. Only a handful of female soccer players, like Michelle
Akers _ also a member of the U.S. women's team _ attracted any
attention. Now, with role models like Hamm, girls are even more
inspired to join, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put the team together in 1994, we were age 10 and
under, but we had to play 11 and under because there were just no
club teams,'' said Fodor, whose team is three-time state champion
and two-time winner of the Far West Regional Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you see teams under age 9 and 10. There's just such a
great amount of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1992, there were no women's soccer teams at the
University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Southern
California; Pepperdine; or Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   But now, young girls are seeing opportunities are available for
them, mainly college scholarships, said Fred Singer, president of
the Valley United Soccer Club, which is made up of 24 teams, of
which half are girl's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see soccer as a great avenue for young girls to advance on
to the college level,'' said Singer, who has alumni players who
have gone on to Ivy League universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think girls look up to the women's national program very
much so and leaders like Mia Hamm,'' Singer said. ``That's the only
place they have to look to at this point in time because the United
States doesn't have a professional program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm has more than just an avid female-fan base. Her
high-profile position also has attracted male admirers, said Jim
Rickard, men's soccer coach at The Master's College and coordinator
of its youth soccer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just girls seeing Mia Hamm, my college guys are very
complimentary of our U.S. women's team ... and it's always the
utmost respect when they talk about Mia,'' said Rickard, whose camp
of about 70 soccer players, ages 5 to 15, is about 40 percent
female.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica first heard of Hamm last year during the Women's World
Cup and was instantly awed by her kicking techniques, but what
impressed her most was her attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a really good sport, she doesn't brag about herself and
she cheers on her teammates,'' Jessica said. ``She could beat any
male player.''
