SPORTS COLUMN:   STANDARDS ARE HIGH FOR MIA HAMM

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ She has not scored in six games. In some
sports that would be a disaster, in others a slump. In soccer, six
games without a goal could be considered a mere statistical blip,
but not for the productive and marketable Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the primitive soccer environment of the United States,
people are beginning to harbor expectations. Americans expected
Steve Sampson and the American men to be better than whining
incompetents in the 1998 World Cup in France. Hip fans expect
Norway-United States in women's soccer to make the arena rumble,
every time.
</P>
<P>
   There are also the expectations of Mia Hamm, she of the burning
eyes, she of the feral rampages. When she does not score, there is
the vague sense of disorientation, like, ``Isn't the weather
supposed to get warm right about now?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm says it is no big deal. She does not make predictions, but
she might very well score one or two Sunday afternoon when the
United States plays China in Giants Stadium in a major tuneup game
for the Women's World Cup in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals will come,'' Hamm said. ``I feel I'm playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   She is indeed playing well. With two vintage runs, Hamm was
directly responsible for both goals in Thursday night's 2-1 victory
over China in Hershey, Pa., with a goal in injury time. She also
clanged the goal post with a shot, and shot wide once, and was
generally the offensive beast of prey that has made her the most
renowned female soccer player on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mia played a great game, one of her best in a long
time,'' said her coach, Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   On a team of veterans, Hamm is the one with 104 career goals in
166 international games, three goals short of the women's world
record, held by Elisabetta Vignotto of Italy. She said it doesn't
matter who scores, but her teammate Michelle Akers respectfully
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I played up front,'' said Akers, who has moved
into the midfield at age 33. ``I was expected to score, and I
expected myself to score. We know Mia scores goals. We want her to
score goals. We need to put people away earlier than we are doing.
But, she's playing well, and she's drawing two defenders, and her
goals will come.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Hamm is becalmed, and people notice, because Hamm
is the one with the silken tresses in the shampoo commercial,
because she is the one on the magazine covers, the golden scorer
who just might persuade businesspeople that a women's league could
draw fans to neat little stadiums like the one in Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be fair, but goal-scorers have more tangible
expectations than the rest of their teammates. Ask Batistuta. Ask
Ronaldo. Ask Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   Or, ask Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is not an individual sport,'' she establishes on Page 5
of her book, ``Go for the Goal,'' soon to be published by
HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't score all the goals, and the ones I do score are
usually the product of a team effort,'' Hamm writes. ``I don't keep
the ball out of the back of the net on the other end of the field.
I don't plan our game tactics. I don't wash our training gear (OK,
sometimes I do), and I don't make our airline reservations. I am a
member of the team, and I rely on the team. I defer to it and
sacrifice for it, because the team, not the individual, is the
ultimate champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite right. This team, however, was constructed with the
general assumption that No. 9 would come roaring down the right
side, find an open spot in the defense and score a goal.
</P>
<P>
   She was on her way in the 20th minute Thursday until a Chinese
defender hauled her down. Hamm was still shaking off the impact as
Akers converted the penalty kick. Then in the 92nd minute, Hamm
caught up with a bold Shannon MacMillan pass, turned the corner and
blasted a shot that the goalkeeper could only deflect. Tisha
Venturini, coming off a 40-yard run, converted for the winning
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia draws two people to her,'' Venturini said. ``She creates
space for the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm said she is simply playing her game, but she admitted that
the long haul toward Summer Games and World Cups does wear players
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Hamm said. ``But we're playing with a new
enthusiasm. I've been hard on myself, but I have to remember that
China is one of the best teams. Their defenders are so technical,
so athletic, and they challenge you on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects the Chinese to haunt her, the Norwegians to jostle
her, the defenders to pack around her. For all that, people expect
Mia Hamm not to go six games without a goal. There were no
expectations like this when women's soccer started to take off a
decade ago. It is a sign of success, albeit probably an annoying
one to the scorer herself.
