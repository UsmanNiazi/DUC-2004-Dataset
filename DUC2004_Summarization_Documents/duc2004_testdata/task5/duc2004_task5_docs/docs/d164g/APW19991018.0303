	NEW YORK (AP) -- Juli Inkster thinks with a little work, soccer  
star Mia Hamm might make it on the LPGA Tour someday. 
</P>
<P>
	But she knows Hamm is more interested in launching a women's  
professional soccer league before retiring to the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Inkster and Hamm were honored as Sportswomen of the  
Year by the Women's Sports Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Inkster could swap golf lessons for soccer tips for her 5-  
and 9-year-old daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They loved following the World Cup,'' Inkster said. ``They  
were all over it. They got to meet them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, the most prolific scorer in women's soccer, was chosen in  
the team sport category. She helped the U.S. team capture the 1999 
Women's World Cup before a record crowd of 90,185 fans at the Rose 
Bowl final July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster, who won five LPGA titles this season to earn a spot in  
the Hall of Fame, was selected in the individual category. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hamm, who has a 13 handicap, the next goal is establishing a  
women's pro soccer league after the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see it happen, and 2001 is probably the best bet to  
launch it,'' Hamm said. ``Hopefully, the success from last summer 
and the excitement for the Olympics will get this thing going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm isn't certain the women's pro league will be partnered with  
Major League Soccer. Unlike the NBA, which finances the WNBA, the 
men's soccer league does not have such deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it can succeed on its own,'' Hamm said. ``What we don't  
want is just for it to be around for a couple of years. We want it 
to endure the test of time and be around for my kids to play in. We 
want to make sure we do it right and get a solid foundation before 
we jump into anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now the players bask in the glow of the World Cup with  
the victory tour and a series of indoor soccer exhibitions that 
begins Friday in Pittsburgh. The 12-city tour against an 
international team ends Dec. 15 in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster, who won the U.S. Open, is enjoying her best season in  
17 years on the tour. She once went five years without a tour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I could be a mom and play golf,'' she said. ``It's  
a fine balance. I have a lot of support at home. It's not easy, but 
I am doing what I love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After achieving her goal of winning the U.S. Open, Inkster won  
the LPGA Championship to become only the fourth woman to win the 
career Grand Slam, joining Pat Bradley, Louise Suggs and Mickey 
Wright. She gained the final point for the Hall of Fame last month 
with a victory in the Safeway Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they changed the Hall of Fame criteria, I was like, `I  
need seven points, two majors and three tournaments, there's no 
way.''' she said. ``And that's just what I did this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Inkster is vying with Karrie Webb for Player of  
the Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Player of the Year is important, but getting in the Hall of  
Fame was my No. 1 thing,'' she said. ``Whatever comes next is 
gravy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the eight surviving cofounders of the LPGA attended  
Women's Sports Foundation dinner. Among those attending the 
festivities was Aileen Riggin Soule, a gold medalist diver at the 
1920 Antwerp Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Other award winners: golfers Sandra Haynie and Betty Jameson;  
marathon runner Joan Benoit Samuelson; former Temple lacrosse coach 
Tina Sloan Green; Olympic track star Gail Devers; and Deborah 
Slaner Larkin, former executive director of the foundation.
