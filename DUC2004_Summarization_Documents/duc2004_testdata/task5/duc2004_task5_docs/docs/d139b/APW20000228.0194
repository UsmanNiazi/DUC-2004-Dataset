<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Joerg Haider, whose anti-foreigner statements and
past praise of aspects of the Nazi regime brought international condemnation on
Austria's new government, resigned Monday as head of the far-right Freedom
Party, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Haider made the announcement at a closed-door meeting of
the group's national leadership at a downtown hotel. The officials, who asked
not to be identified, said a formal announcement would be made at a news
conference later Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who holds no post in the national government, is to stay on as
governor of Carinthia province. The move was seen as an attempt to reduce
international criticism of the new coalition government between Haider's
rightists and the center-right Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Austria Press Agency quoted party sources as saying Haider will be
succeeded as party chief by his trusted lieutenant, Vice Chancellor Susanne
Riess-Passer, 39.
</P>
<P>
   APA said Haider told the party leadership meeting that he was stepping down
because he did not want ``to stand in the way'' of the work of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 other European Union members have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of Haider's party in the government which took office
Feb. 4. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand and his past
praise of veterans of the murderous Waffen SS and Adolf Hitler's ``orderly''
employment policies.
</P>
<P>
   Some Austrian politicians and commentators doubted that the resignation
signaled the end of Haider's influence on the national government. Riess-Passer
and others in the Freedom Party leadership have long-established reputations as
Haider disciples who owe their political positions to him.
</P>
<P>
   The newly elected head of the opposition Social Democratic party, Alfred
Gusenbauer, said the resignation was simply ``one of Haider's many tactical
tricks'' and would give the coalition a respite from criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Prinzhorn, the Freedom Party's candidate for chancellor in the Oct. 3
parliamentary election, said Haider's resignation did not signal his withdrawal
from national politics and that the controversial Carinthia governor would
remain the ``top man'' of the party.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said Haider's
decision was the ``first sign of a breath of fresh air'' since Haider's party
finished second in the parliamentary elections, which paved the way for the
party to join the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Hier said the international criticism was pivotal in forcing Haider to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only hope that his resignation sends a strong message to other members
of the Freedom Party that no one is prepared to accept a party whose platform is
based on xenophobia and bigotry,'' Hier told The Associated Press. ``We hope the
Freedom Party will get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom Party's EU representative,
said Haider had mentioned stepping down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sichrovsky said stepping down as party head would allow Haider to
concentrate more on politics in Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the international furor, Haider remains popular with many Austrians
and within the party that he nearly single-handedly built up from a small,
unknown group to the second-largest political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986. Since last March, he has also
served as governor of Carinthia province.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party used widespread concern over the impact of immigration and EU
expansion on Austrian jobs to finish second in the parliamentary election with
52 of the 183 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The left-leaning Social Democrats finished first, winning 65 seats but too
few to govern on their own.
</P>
<P>
   At EU ministerial meetings on Monday, Austrian delegates were publicly
shunned. At a defense ministers meeting in Sintra, Portugal, Andre Flahaut, the
Belgian delegate, skipped lunch, telling reporters, ``I don't eat with
fascists,'' in protest against the presence of Austrian Defense Minister Herbert
Scheibner.
</P>
<P>
   Scheibner belongs to Haider's Freedom Party. So does Karl-Heinz Grasser,
Austria's finance minister, who got a frosty welcome at his first EU gathering
in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   French diplomats said ministers including their own declined to shake hands
with Grasser.
</P>
<P>
   News photographers, allowed in for the start of the meeting, said no other
ministers spoke to Grasser. French and Belgian officials wore stickers depicting
a ``no-entry'' traffic sign superimposed on a bow-tie -- the trademark of
conservative Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.
