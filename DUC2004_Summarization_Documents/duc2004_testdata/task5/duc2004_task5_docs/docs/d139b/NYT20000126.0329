RIGHT-WING POLITICIAN'S COALITION TALKS STIR NEGATIVE REACTIONS
OUTSIDE AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ Several countries reacted with dismay on Wednesday to
the news that Jorg Haider, leader of the right-wing Freedom Party,
was in negotiations to form a coalition government in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose party came in second in October elections, is best
known abroad for his anti-immigrant stance and for remarks he has
made expressing sympathy for Third Reich labor policies and Nazi SS
war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the parties that came in first and third said
efforts to rebuild their longtime ruling coalition had collapsed
after three months of talks. Haider's party has spent two days
negotiating with the Austrian People's Party, which has a
conservative, pro-business, pro-church stance and is led by the
current foreign minister, Wolfgang Schussel.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Haider would not become chancellor because he is
presently governor of the southern state of Carinthia, but he
remains the party's chief strategist and rules it with a tight
grip.
</P>
<P>
   News of the negotiations prompted Israel's foreign minister,
David Levy, to announce that his country would ``re-evaluate our
relations'' with Austria. In the past, Israel has threatened to
break off diplomatic ties if Haider becomes part of a ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, in a statement worded carefully to avoid
appearing to interfere with its small neighbor, which it annexed
before World War II, acknowledged the ``voices of concern raised
inside Austria and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The French were significantly stronger, issuing comments from
the foreign minister saying Austria would put itself in a
``deplorable position'' with Haider in government. Quoting Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, a government spokeswoman said exciting
imaginary fears to create populist movements was ``detestable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's prime minister, Goran Persson, said developments in
Austria were ``not in line'' with the values of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And Prime Minister Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic compared
Haider to other leaders of right-wing political parties in Europe,
including Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Jean Marie Le Pen of France,
Vladimir Meciar of Slovakia and Vladimir Zhirinovsky of Russia.
Reuters quoted him as saying they all ``represent danger for
democratic life,'' and ``Haider represents risks for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   European Jewish groups, student groups and labor groups also
reacted negatively to the news of Haider's ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, foreign leaders condemned and avoided Austria after
Kurt Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, was elected
president. Waldheim was found to have lied about his wartime past,
during which he was in a unit involved in atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   But today Austria is not a small neutral country but a member of
the European Union and in line to preside over the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is playing a leading role
in policing the former Yugoslavia and building democracy in the
countries of the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who turned 50 on Wednesday, apologized for his remarks
in November, saying he was sorry he hurt the feelings of those who
suffered under Naziism and insisted that Naziism had no part in his
personal values, which he described as ``tolerance and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sichrovsky, a Jewish leader in Haider's party, called them
``a couple of stupid remarks that are constantly quoted.'' On a
recent tour of the United States, where he long ago took his
daughters to visit the Holocaust Museum, Haider insisted he was ``a
pure democrat.'' His parents were avid followers of Hitler, but
many postwar baby boomers are in the same position.
</P>
<P>
   A witty, relaxed speaker whose October campaign featured
narcissistic commercials lingering on images of his tanned face,
Haider endorses a total ban on immigration, uses words like
``uberfremdung'' (over-foreignization) that are redolent of the
Third Reich, and raises the chilling specter of drug dealers taking
over his country, which is a tranquil Alpine land with minuscule
crime rates. His adherents say his anti-immigrant stance is not
race-based, but stems from fear that cheap laborers from eastern
Europe will take the high-paying jobs of his unionized followers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, while in Stockholm for a conference on the
Holocaust, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel told reporters,
according to Reuters, that ``for every Jew in the world, the rise
to power of an extreme right-wing party in Austria is a highly
disturbing signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has denied having any anti-Semitic feelings and
anti-Semitism has never been part of his campaign platforms.
