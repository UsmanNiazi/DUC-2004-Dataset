<HEADLINE> Haider Strikes Power Share Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Outspoken populist Joerg Haider on Tuesday
negotiated a deal to allow his far-right party to share power in Austria's
government -- despite warnings from the United States and the European Union
that such a move could lead to Austria's diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel reached the agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government
between Haider's party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to try this path,'' declared Haider. ``This government
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider and Schuessel offered no details on the composition of their
government or details of their program. But in an attempt to defuse
international criticism, both politicians pledged that tolerance would be high
on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence to indicate that anyone is going to have to leave
this country,'' Haider said, referring to charges that his party's stance on
immigration is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The deal can still be rejected by President Thomas Klestil, who could call
new elections or propose other alternatives. But he is unlikely to do so. Haider
and Schuessel planned to meet with Klestil on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, while talks were still under way, the Clinton administration warned
that the United States would carefully examine its relations with Austria if
Haider's party moved into a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate State Department response to the agreement, but
earlier Tuesday, spokesman James Foley said the United States is ``continuing to
keep the situation under review'' and added that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had called Schuessel on Tuesday. He offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of Haider's party stems in part from his past hostility to the EU,
his opposition to immigration and remarks sympathetic to aspects of Adolf
Hitler's regime. The EU's 14 other members have threatened to isolate Austria
politically if Haider's party gains power.
</P>
<P>
   Haider gained international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has since apologized for those comments
</P>
<P>
   Haider has also spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would threaten
jobs in Austria. Haider has predicted that the new government would impose a
nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch,
said it would continue a ``working relation'' with the new government as long as
it abides by the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But individual EU countries, including Britain, Germany and France, have
warned that they would reduce ties to any government coalition with Freedom
Party participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it,'' Italy's left-wing
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, told Italian radio Tuesday. ``If these are
thrown into question, Europe has a right to speak its mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU action was a shock to this small alpine country of 7.8 million
people, which is only now recovering from the diplomatic isolation brought about
when former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected president in 1986
after trying to conceal his role as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, the EU said it would curtail bilateral contacts with
Austria, oppose appointments of Austrian candidates to international
organizations and limit contacts with Vienna's ambassadors in EU capitals if
Haider's party shares power.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, 30 lawmakers signed a petition Tuesday asking Austria's president
to keep Haider out of the government. The petition, which was to be presented to
the Austrian ambassador to Israel on Wednesday, said Haider's party ``recalls
the dark days of persecution against minorities'' and that ``the rule of the
Nazi regime also began with democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria has been without a stable government since inconclusive
parliamentary elections Oct. 3 propelled Haider's party into second place ahead
of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima's first-place Social
Democrats and the People's Party to renew their 13-year coalition collapsed last
month, paving the way for talks with Haider's group.
