<HEADLINE> EU Sanctions To Start for Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union has set unprecedented political
sanctions to isolate one of its own member nations the moment a new government
including a far-right party takes office in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The measures against Austria are to kick in automatically today once the
government with its Freedom Party ministers is sworn in, said Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The EU's unusually strong move reflects deep concern provoked by Freedom
Party leader Joerg Haider, who has in the past expressed sympathy with aspects
of Nazism and has opposed EU enlargement into eastern Europe, saying it could
spark a new wave of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole range of values which underpin our civilization are at stake,''
Guterres said in Lisbon on Thursday. ``We will pay maximum attention to the
actions of the Austrian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the sanctions, ministers from the other 14 members will halt all
bilateral contacts with their Austrian counterparts. Austrian ministers will
still be able to take their seats at the Union's regular meetings, but will be
frozen out of backroom negotiations that are often vital for forging consensus
within the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals will be shunned for all except
``technical talks'' and no EU nation will support Austrian candidates proposed
for international posts.
</P>
<P>
   The measures were agreed Monday by the other 14 EU nations in a break with
their traditional stance of non-interference in each other's internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haider on Thursday signed a declaration renouncing Austria's Nazi
past and promised to respect European values, Austria's EU partners remained
unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Haider's views didn't have ``any
place in the modern Europe that we are trying to create,'' the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The naked appeal to xenophobia on which Mr. Haider has based his platform
on which he has sought votes and which he continues to peddle is something that
strikes against the basis of the European Union,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament cautioned Austria's very participation in the EU
could be suspended if the new government fails to respect democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The warning and a condemnation of Haider was passed 406 to 53 by the EU
assembly just before Austria's President Thomas Klestil reluctantly approved the
government coalition comprising ministers from the Freedom Party and the
conservative Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   The EU assembly condemned ``all the insulting, xenophobic and racist
statements issued by (Haider) over many years.''
</P>
<P>
   If Austria fails to uphold the Union's founding principles, the parliament
urged the other 14 EU nations to ``suspend that state's rights'' under the
Union's founding treaty -- a move that would effectively exclude Austria from
participating in EU decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EU treaty, member governments with the backing of the European
Parliament can suspend the voting rights of any nation guilty of ``a serious or
persistent breach'' of ``the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would be unprecedented in the EU's 43-year history.
</P>
<P>
   European governments were already making good their threat to cut ties with
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   French Defense Minister Alain Richard postponed a meeting with Austria on
European defense, Danish diplomats pulled out of a dinner scheduled today by the
Austrian embassy in Copenhagen, and Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio was
expected to cancel a visit to Austria.
