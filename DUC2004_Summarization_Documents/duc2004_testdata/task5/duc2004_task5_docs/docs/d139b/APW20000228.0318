<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing leader Joerg Haider, criticized for his
anti-foreigner statements and past praise of some Nazi-era policies, resigned as
head of the Freedom Party Monday in an apparent bid to end Austria's
international ostracism following his party's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who remains governor of Austria's Carinthia province, insisted that
his decision does not mean he is retiring from national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to avoid our ministers having to face the claim that they must
refer every decision to the shadow chancellor in Carinthia,'' Haider told
reporters. ``The Freedom Party ministers are not puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Haider holds no post in the national government, his controversial
image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom Party made him the most visible
member of the Austrian political establishment, eclipsing his coalition
partners, the center-right Austrian People's Party of Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel. The Freedom Party remains a member of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, 50, announced his resignation at a closed-door meeting of his
party's national leadership at a hotel in downtown Vienna. He will be succeeded
as party chief by his trusted lieutenant, Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer,
39.
</P>
<P>
   She told reporters she had not wanted Haider to step aside, but she said she
respects his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some Austrian politicians and commentators said they doubted that Haider's
resignation signaled the end of his influence on the national government.
Riess-Passer and others in the Freedom Party leadership have long-established
reputations as Haider disciples who owe their political positions to him.
</P>
<P>
   The newly elected head of the opposition Social Democratic party, Alfred
Gusenbauer, said the resignation was simply ``one of Haider's many tactical
tricks'' and would give the coalition a respite from criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Prinzhorn, a senior Freedom Party official, said Haider would remain
the ``top man'' of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The Austria Press Agency said Haider told the party leadership meeting that
he was stepping down because he did not want ``to stand in the way'' of the work
of the new government.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 other European Union members have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of Haider's party in the government which took office
Feb. 4. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand and his past
praise of veterans of the murderous Waffen SS and Adolf Hitler's ``orderly''
employment policies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Haider bristled at suggestions that he was bowing to foreign
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept no pressure from outside,'' he told reporters. ``We are
accustomed to making our own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from other EU members. In Washington,
however, State Department spokesman James Rubin said Haider's resignation was a
``step in the right direction'' but noted that the Freedom Party remains in the
government, ``so we'll be watching their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said Haider's decision was
the ``first sign of a breath of fresh air'' since Haider's party finished second
in the Oct. 3 parliamentary elections, which paved the way to joining the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Hier said the international criticism was pivotal in forcing Haider to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only hope that his resignation sends a strong message to other members
of the Freedom Party that no one is prepared to accept a party whose platform is
based on xenophobia and bigotry,'' Hier told The Associated Press. ``We hope the
Freedom Party will get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom Party's EU representative,
said Haider had mentioned stepping down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the international furor, Haider remains popular with many Austrians
and within the party he nearly single-handedly built up from a small, unknown
group to the second-largest political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986 and was elected governor of
Carinthia province in March.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party exploited widespread concern over the impact of immigration
and EU expansion on Austrian jobs to finish second in the parliamentary election
with 52 of the 183 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The left-leaning Social Democrats finished first, winning 65 seats but too
few to govern on their own.
</P>
<P>
   At EU ministerial meetings on Monday, Austrian delegates were publicly
shunned. At a defense ministers meeting in Sintra, Portugal, Belgian delegate
Andre Flahaut skipped lunch, telling reporters, ``I don't eat with fascists,''
in protest against the presence of Austrian Defense Minister Herbert Scheibner.
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Heinz Grasser, Austria's finance minister, also got a frosty welcome at
his first EU gathering in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   French diplomats said ministers including their own declined to shake hands
with Grasser.
