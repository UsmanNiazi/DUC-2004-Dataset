EUROPEAN UNION WARNS AUSTRIA ABOUT ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTY JOINING
GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ The European Union warned on Monday that its 14 other
members would diplomatically isolate Austria if its anti-immigrant
Freedom Party led by Jorg Haider enters a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued in Portugal, said the other members of the
European Union ``will not promote or accept any bilateral official
contacts at a political level'' with any Austrian government that
included Haider's party. Portugal now holds the European Union's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations
would find no support, it said, and Austrian ambassadors ``will
only be received at a technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that ``the Portuguese prime minister and the minister of
foreign affairs had already informed the Austrian authorities that
there would be no business as usual in the bilateral relations with
a government integrating'' Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Portuguese television, Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres of Portugal justified the action, saying: ``We had to send
a very clear signal that behavior of a racist or xenophobic
character will not be tolerated within the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the union has issued such a warning to a
member state. Austrians were shocked, and a diplomatic crisis seems
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it strange if the 14 EU states were to come to such a
decision without consultations with the member state Austria,'' The
Associated Press quoted Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's own reaction, Reuters said, was that if the president
and other parties bowed to foreign pressure, ``then we might as
well abolish democracy in this country straight away.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it became clear last week that Haider had a chance of
being in the government, the European news media have been full of
articles implying that Nazism is on the rise in Austria, a charge
that many Austrians vigorously reject and resent.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party, which favors cutting off immigration to Austria
and preventing European Union expansion because it is likely to
bring more eastern Europeans over Austria's borders, came in second
in the October elections, with 27 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The party's share of the votehas grown from 5 percent when
Haider took over in 1986, but political analysts say it is not
entirely because of its stance on immigration. Instead, they say,
the party's supporters are fed up with the cozy patronage
relationship between the Social Democrats, in power for 30 years,
and the People's Party, which has governed jointly with them for
the last 13.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the first-place Social Democrats and the third-place
People's Party failed to revive their coalition. So Haider began
negotiations with the People's Party on forming a coalition with
104 seats in the 183-seat legislature, squeezing out the Social
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Israel immediately reiterated a threat made in October to cut
off diplomatic relations. Other European countries, led by France
and Belgium, steadily ratcheted up their denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Austrians seemed dumbstruck on Monday by the European
announcement. ``This is very, very, very, very strange,'' said
Alexander van der Bellen, the leader of the Green Party, which came
in fourth in October. ``As an Austrian, I feel terrible. As head of
the Green Party, I can only say that we wanted to block the
participation of the Freedom Party in government, but still. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The threats, he said, would probably only make Austrians more
likely to snap back that ``no foreigners can tell us what to do,''
as was the case when they elected Kurt Waldheim as president after
he had been soundly condemned abroad for lying about the fact that
he had been an officer in a German army unit that committed
atrocities in Yugoslavia during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Haider contends that the hostility is really panic by Social
Democrats elsewhere Europe and that even Israel is reacting largely
to the prospect of an ally being forced out of power.
</P>
<P>
   He also says his critics know almost nothing about him.
President Jacques Chirac of France, Haider said this weekend,
``greeted me warmly at a state reception'' not long ago, ``and now
suddenly he is against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, gave a radio
interview on Monday in which he enumerated ways that a European
country could be punished if it was found to have violated
fundamental human rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``what we want is for them to give up'' on plans to
let the Freedom Party into government. ``But if they don't, then
Austria will be under surveillance as no country has ever been in
the European Union,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to characterize Haider because his positions are
all over the political map. Van der Bellen of the Green Party has
called him an opportunist and a ``political chameleon,'' and many
Austrian analysts agree. Imitating Newt Gingrich, he calls his
platform, ``Contract With Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   He is definitely opposed to more immigration, and has used the
word ``over-foreignization,'' which many find redolent of Naziism.
He implies that immigrants are responsible for Austria's crime rate
and ``drug problem,'' although both are negligible, for welfare
fraud and for increases in tuberculosis in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   His words may fall on receptive ears because Austrians are
heavily taxed, and until recently, the country has had liberal
asylum policies and benefits for Balkan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But he also gives voice to the frustration with the bickering
and the patronage machines of the Social Democrats and the People's
Party, a renamed Christian Democrat party. Austrians are so
disgusted with the two parties' failure to form a government since
October that polls suggest that if new elections were held today,
Haider would get 33 percent of the vote.
