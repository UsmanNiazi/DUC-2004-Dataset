<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider May Meet with Pope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian right-wing politician Joerg
Haider may be received by Pope John Paul II during a Christmastime
visit to Italy, the Austria Press Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the governor of the southern province of Carinthia, is
likely to head a delegation presenting a Christmas tree to the
Vatican on December 16, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's recent visit to northern Italy led to demonstrations
protesting his politics, which include echoes of some Nazi
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the European Union has imposed sanctions against
Austria because Haider's far-right Freedom Party is in the Austrian
government coalition. Haider has since stepped down as party chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian ambassador to the Vatican, Gustav Ortner, said it
was ''entirely possible'' Haider would lead the delegation. An
audience with the pope is considered ''normal'' for such a
delegation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican Christmas tree traditionally comes from a central
European country, and is displayed in St. Peter's Square. The
agreement to receive a tree from Carinthia dates to 1997, before
Haider became governor.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second meeting for Haider and John Paul II; he
and his family were received by the pope in 1993.
