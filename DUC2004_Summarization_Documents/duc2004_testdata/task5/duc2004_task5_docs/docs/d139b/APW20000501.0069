<HEADLINE> Haider Quits As Freedom Party Chief  </HEADLINE>

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Joerg Haider officially resigned Monday
as head of his far-right party in the same way he's led it for the
past 14 years -- with a speech lashing out at his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the annual Freedom Party congress overwhelmingly
elected Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, Haider's personal
choice, to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Haider announced in February that he would be stepping down, but
the official change of office was left for the party's congress in
Klagenfurt, capital of Carinthia province, where Haider is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute speech to the congress, Haider, 50, called for
unity under Riess-Passer's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FPO should not change!'' Haider told the delegates, using
the Austrian acronym for his party. ''It must be our goal to work
so hard in the future that in the next election, there will be no
shift to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first speech as party head, Riess-Passer, 39, told
Haider: ''You can always count on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came after several months of international and
domestic protest against the Freedom Party's inclusion in the
Austrian government. The party received 27 percent of the vote in
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that although Haider is no longer in charge,
he will continue to exercise an enormous influence over the party,
pointing out that Riess-Passer lacks his gift for public speaking
and populist flair.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, 50, gained notoriety for praising the ''orderly'' full
employment policies of Adolf Hitler, and calling Waffen SS veterans
''men of honor.'' He has repeatedly apologized for such remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But his apologies have done little to stifle international
criticism of Austria, also fed by the perception that the Freedom
Party is rabidly anti-foreigner. He hopes stepping down as party
head will change that.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Freedom Party joined the ruling coalition with the
conservative People's Party of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel in
early February, other individual European Union countries have
frozen diplomatic relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The European Community as a whole has threatened sanctions as it
has pledged to monitor closely the Austrian government's
performance and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said Monday the Freedom Party would continue to pressure
the government to hold a referendum on what Austrians think of the
sanctions threat. Numerous polls have already showed that Austrians
resent any foreign pressure to change their government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the EU has been dealing with Austria is not compatible
from the European humanism that we would hope for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum would also pressure Austrian President Thomas
Klestil -- a past critic of Haider -- to back the government in
protesting the sanctions, he said, something Klestil has so far
been reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president cannot act as though he had nothing to do with
this government. He approved it and is thereby required to stand by
it,'' Haider said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 14-year tenure as leader, Haider built the Freedom Party
up from a small group to the second-strongest party in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He told the 690 congress delegates that his decision to step
down was a necessity, as it was no longer possible the party's
members of government ''to remain continually under the suspicion
of simply being marionettes whose strings are pulled in
Carinthia.''
