<P>
   It would have been better for Austria if one of its mainstream
parties had been able to form a government alone after the
inconclusive general election last October.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better, too, if more of Austria's voters had
told Jorg Haider, the leader of the xenophobic and right-wing
Freedom Party, to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union's reaction to the prospect of the Freedom
Party joining a ruling coalition has been hypocritical and wholly
disproportionate to Austria's supposed offense in seeking to build
a stable government backed by a majority of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the EU's constitution, in letter or spirit,
that says its members should exclude from office even extreme
nationalists, so long as they are democratic and act within the
law. Nor would such exclusion be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Hectoring from abroad _ the United States has been doing it too
_ is precisely what bolsters flag-wavers like Haider, who likes to
present himself as a champion of ``plucky little Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Haider is a crude populist. He has only reluctantly
come around to Austria's membership of the EU and he is loth to see
ex-communist countries from the east welcomed in. He wants to curb
immigration, has used some crass language about foreigners and
talks of the threat that outsiders pose to Austria's identity.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is noble. He has also made two much-quoted
statements that seem far too friendly to the memory of Hitler, whom
he now roundly if belatedly condemns.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike other (much smaller) parties in Austria, Haider's
group has never promoted itself as neo-Nazi, nor has its leader
expressed anti-Semitic views. He does not incite violence against
foreigners or ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he has some nasty supporters; so do most parties. But
many Freedom voters are quite respectable, especially those who are
loyal to the more libertarian tradition of the party, which, before
Haider took over, governed in coalition with the Socialists in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They, and others, are motivated less by racism than by a belief
that the established parties of Austria's center-right and
center-left have been involved for too long in a corrupt carve-up
of power and patronage. At least about that, they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   There are several parties in European countries, including EU
members, that are directly descended from communist or fascist
parties that once condoned mass-murder.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's post-fascists _ lineal heirs of Mussolini, however much
they may have fumigated themselves _ have been in coalition
government, and are now accepted, on the left as well as the right,
as part of the democratic fabric.
</P>
<P>
   A senior minister in Franco's authoritarian regime founded an
alliance that evolved into the immaculately center-right, would-be
Blairite party now ruling Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Communists whose forebears nourished Stalin, and have been
notoriously tardy in condemning his crimes, today sit in ministries
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Haider may be no better than such people. But he is not much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, in contrast to its German-speaking big brother to
the north, Austria has been notably feeble over the years in facing
up to its past. The mainstream conservatives were reluctant to
acknowledge the grubby war record of Kurt Waldheim, who was
Austria's president from 1986 to 1992 after being the
secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Social Democrats have been prone to portray Austrians
as mere victims of Nazism, although their country had a higher
membership of the party, proportional to population, than Germany
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Austrians _ Haider emphatically included _
have yet to do their share of post-Nazi repentance. But, smelly as
he is, Haider is neither a Nazi nor a threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Austrians want him in government, outsiders should not
stand in the way. &QL;
