WILT WOULD HAVE LOVED ALL THE ATTENTION

   Wilt Chamberlain was a giant of a man whose ego, libido and
footprint on the NBA could not be measured.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chamberlain, there might have been 20,000 women,
but only one Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   He died Tuesday in Bel Air, Calif., at age 63 from what
authorities speculate was an apparent heart attack. The feeling
here is that it would have pleased Wilt that today his picture is
in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed him once, too long ago to remember exactly when.
Actually I stood there in a group, tucked in a hallway just off the
basketball floor at the Great Western Forum, and I scribbled while
Chamberlain spoke.
</P>
<P>
   As I recall, Wilt was pontificating about his favorite subject _
namely, that he was the best basketball player alive. Even though
he was in his 40s and had retired probably 10 years prior.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, he was right. Coming out of the University of
Kansas, Chamberlain had singlehandedly pushed the NBA into a new
generation by being both undeniably tall and richly athletic. He
could run and he could jump. He supposedly taught himself tennis
and became the darling of the Hollywood doubles scene. He took up
volleyball and became one of the country's best.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball was different in the 1960s, when the Chamberlain
legend first grew larger than life. The 24-second clock had
unleashed a nightly assault on the basket. The notion of somebody
averaging 50 points per night, as Wilt did in 1961-62, seems a tall
tale in this day of hip-check defenses and eight 7-footers crashing
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the feat was yawned at. Chamberlain's numbers were so
prolific, they trivialized themselves. I have no memory of even his
extraordinary 100-point game on March 2, 1962 making the front page
of my hometown's sports section.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what puffed up Wilt Chamberlain, prompted him to
write about his sexual exploits and regularly try to keep the
modern NBA in its place. Maybe he was simply trying to protect his
own legend, as if all of the points and all of the rebounds had
been deemed frivolous by their volume.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong, of course. As time grew, so did the basketball
legend of Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   He left Kansas one year early and in that one grand tour, Wilt
became the most gifted Harlem Globetrotter who ever played. Long
before Michael Jordan brought his dominating personal style to the
game, Wilt took the NBA firmly by the neck. In a game against the
Boston Celtics in 1960, Chamberlain pulled down 55 rebounds. Seven
seasons later, presumably just because he wanted to, Wilt led the
league in assists.
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Dan Issel said Tuesday, ``As I grew up, Wilt the
Stilt was the player _ just the things he was able to do. I guess
one year they told him he couldn't make as much money as he wanted
because he couldn't pass the ball, so he went out and led the
league in assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Wilt, you always kind of got the idea he was just
playing with people. That he was on cruise control and still 10
times better than anybody else that was playing at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   It bothered Chamberlain, it was widely written, that though he
won two NBA championships, he carried the label of The Guy Who
Couldn't Beat Bill Russell. In truth, they were two distinct types
of players _ Russell being the ultimate team player on the ultimate
team, and Chamberlain forced to shoulder his teams' loads.
</P>
<P>
   In today's game, Wilt would have been the wealthiest player in
the game. Russell would be paid like Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chamberlain ever seemed to hurt for money. He benefited
richly by playing for the Lakers as they burst into trendy
prominence in Los Angeles. Hollywood stars embraced him. Wilt
became a regular at the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his memoirs, his autobiography ``A View From
Above,'' Wilt ventured the opinion that he had had sex with 20,000
different women. As usual, Chamberlain's numbers betrayed him. The
remark became a running TV joke. On the David Letterman show, the
gag one night involved a makeshift ``Wilt-O-Meter'' that resembled
a running odometer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was hard to take Chamberlain seriously about a
lot of things. His life, as well as his career, seemed almost too
large.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no doubt, some will remember him in print as perhaps the
greatest NBA player ever, which he probably was (forgive me,
Michael Jordan). Most of all, Wilt's picture is back in all the
papers.
</P>
<P>
   He would have liked that.
