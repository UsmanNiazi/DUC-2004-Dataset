<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was an odd relationship _ filled with times of
great friendship and also long periods of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   The strange bond between Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar is, and always will be, hard to understand, surpassing
in puzzlement the fragile relationship between Chamberlain and Bill
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Russell and Chamberlain were contemporaries, rivals
who consistently played against each other in the NBA Finals. It
was inevitable their bond would be strained.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamberlain-and-Abdul-Jabbar feud was more confusing. They
played against each other only four years. In addition, it was
Chamberlain, then an NBA superstar, who befriended Abdul-Jabbar
when he was a high school star in New York City. For a time, he was
Kareem's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity came mostly from Chamberlain, who spent a lot of
time sniping at Abdul-Jabbar in the press once Kareem turned
professional.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, long after Chamberlain retired, he belittled
Abdul-Jabbar's rebounding, and even urged him to retire a few
times. He summed up those feelings in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Kareem,'' Chamberlain said. ``One thing for
sure _ he was blessed with a magnificent body and magnificent
talent. Not to say he loafed, but he never pushed himself to the
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to chastise Kareem. He was the greatest offensive
force I ever faced on the basketball court _ by far. The only time
I ever saw him push himself was against me.''
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Abdul-Jabbar stayed above the fray. But he
did respond in his post-career book, ``My Turn,'' published in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a segment sub-titled ``An Open Letter to Wilt Chumberlame,''
Abdul-Jabbar lashed out at the man he once idolized.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the letter by writing: ``So, now that I have left, one
thing will be part of my legacy: People will remember that I worked
with my teammates and helped us win. You will be remembered as a
whining crybaby and a quitter, stats and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar later said he wrote the letter against the wishes
of the book's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who wanted to do it,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``As a
matter of fact, Mignon (McCarthy, the co-author) said, `Don't do
it, don't do it, it's like getting into a mud-slinging contest.' I
told her I was already covered with mud....
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt had his say for a long time, and I've never really
responded to it, never told my side of it. I just figured I'd have
some fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Abdul-Jabbar released this statement: ``Wilt was one
of the greatest players ever, and we will never see another one
like him.''
