   LOS ANGELES _ There had never been anyone like him, and most
would argue, there never has been since.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilt Chamberlain ever stepped on an NBA floor, the
basketball world knew who he was. By the time he left it, the whole
world did.
</P>
<P>
   He was arguably the NBA's first larger-than-life figure, a giant
in the game both literally and figuratively. He was less loved,
than admired, or maybe feared; less envied that respected.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain brought something to basketball it had never seen
before: a dominating 7-foot-1 center who was athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The centers up until that time may have been big and brawny,
but they didn't have the finesse, the mobility, the speed, the
jumping ability, the array of shots,'' said former NBA star Tommy
Hawkins, now the Dodgers vice president of communications. ``Wilt
brought basketball out of the stone ages into what we consider the
modern game. Wilt was the prime mover in making basketball
showtime, with running flashy dunks, and finger rolls and fade-away
jump shots off the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did all of these things with such grace that had never been
seen from a center before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chamberlain was more than just a special force on the floor.
He was complex, egotistical, intelligent, opinionated. He could
speak several languages. He loved to travel the world. He once
claimed in a book to have slept with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   He looked menacing with that incredible physical presence alone,
but then there was that serious look, that goatee, the aggressive
way he played the game. There was almost something threatening
about him, a man who appeared he could do almost whatever he
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sportswriters who covered him called him fair, kind, honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy who, if you wrote something he didn't
like, he'd call you up and discuss it with you,'' said John Hall, a
former columnist at the Los Angeles Times and Orange County
Register. ``But he did it in a very frank and fair way. There was a
big fued between Wilt and coach (Bill) van Breda Kolff. I loved van
Breda Kolff and always took his side. But Wilt never seemed to
really resent that, except he had a different opinion and he would
call you up and let you know, which I found refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chamberlain died Tuesday at age 63 of an apparent heart
attack in his Bel-Air home famous for a stream running through it,
Hall was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would be the last guy on Earth,'' Hall said.
``(He was) just an awesome force. He was a legend before there were
legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was already a basketball legend in Philadelphia at
Overbrook High School. By the time he went to Kansas, the sports
world was paying close attention. Athletes don't normally come in
7-foot-1, 275-pound frames. And he was an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   He loved track and field. He was a force at volleyball. He once
wanted to fight Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have whupped Ali, I really do,'' said former
Los Angeles Herald-Examiner sports editor Bud Furillo, now a sports
talk host at KXPS in Palm Springs. ``Wilt was the strongest man
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Hawkins ever met Chamberlain wasn't in a
basketball game, but while a junior high jumper at Notre Dame at a
track meet. Chamberlain was a high jumper for Kansas. A 7-1 high
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first meeting against Chamberlain was in the high jump pit
at the Milwaukee Relays,'' Hawkins said. ``I'll never forget that.
I think he won that year with a leap of 6-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins would later play against him in the NBA, and with him
when Chamberlain first came to the Lakers in 1968. Hawkins said it
wasn't just the public or the media that was fascinated by
Chamberlain, but the other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost looked at Wilt in terms of a certain
invincibility,'' Hawkins said. ``People thought of him as ageless,
and he thought of himself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain played one year with the Harlem Globetrotters before
signing with Philadelphia Warriors in the 1959 season. Hall said
that year the Warriors played an exhibition game at the new Sports
Arena and it sold out. The next year, the Lakers moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought basketball into L.A,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he was almost unstoppable. His records defy
description: a record 23,924 rebounds, a 50.4 season scoring
average in 1961-62, a record 100 points in a game, nine times
leading the league in field goal percentage, seven times in scoring
and once in assists, a four-time NBA MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just one of those fabulous players who kind of defined
sports,'' said Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, a former
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he went, Chamberlain was a willing magnet. In an era
before television showed continuous basketball highlights and
created almost instant sensations, Chamberlain was a man and player
ahead of his time. The spotlight seemed always on him, and although
he could seem aloof, it was usually welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was never one to run and hide,'' Hawkins said. ``He loved
walking out there and all of the attention he got. He was Pied
Piper of life. Everywhere he went, he had people following him or
he drew a crowd. He never said he resented it. From the look on his
face, he loved it. He ate it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention also came from the ladies, and also usually
welcomed. His claim of having slept with 20,000 women brought
plenty of chortles but, however exaggerated, there was no doubt he
took advantage of his notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, I think there were a lot of people very
curious about Wilt,'' Hawkins said. ``And I think Wilt was probably
the recipient of a lot of curiosity action.''
</P>
<P>
   But his enduring legacy will be what he brought to the game of
basketball, his classic duels with Bill Russell, how his impact
changed the game forever. There were other stars before
Chamberlain, but he may have been its first megastar, an incredible
physical specimen on the floor and something of an enigma off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a fantastic athlete, people might have taken him
for granted,'' said Elgin Baylor, a former Lakers teammate and now
a Clippers vice president. ``People didn't have a great
appreciation for what he did until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored at will. He believed he could do anything he tried.
And on the basketball court, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like no one before him, like no one since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes right down to it, with all the Michael Jordan
stuff, Wilt is still the single most dominant player to play the
game,'' Hall said. ``The tremendous romance with the game started
with him, not Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the most popular guy in the world. He was the first
true Goliath. And nobody likes the giant. Everybody is out to beat
the giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right to the end, from start to finish, he was a great
story.''
