   NEW YORK _ Gather 'round, children, as we tell you the tale of a
Brobdingnagian man who challenged society, laughed at society, and
may have even mastered society for 63 rollicking years.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Wilton Norman Chamberlain, and the very least we
can say about this man is that there has never been a basketball
player like him.
</P>
<P>
   Ready? An average of 50.4 points a game for an entire season.
One hundred points in a single game. Fifty-five rebounds in a
single game. And then there's my personal favorite Chamberlain
record _ an average of more than 48 minutes a game for an entire
season. Now we can start the argument as to who, if anyone, was
better, but surely we can have no disagreement concerning his
unique stature in the game of basketball. Wilt Chamberlain wasn't
merely in the record book. He was the record book.
</P>
<P>
   If you never saw him play, there's not much I can say other than
you owe it to yourself to seek out some video. You think Shaq is
strong? You think Shaq is unstoppable? Let's just put it this way:
If Wilt was a battleship, Shaq is a rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt was the kind of guy you, please pardon the exprsssion,
``held'' to 40, 45, or even 50 points. It's true. A basic strategy
was that you ``let'' Wilt get his 40, and you tried to hold the
others down. That sounds very odd to the modern ear, this notion of
conceding a man his 40, but those of us who lived through the
Chamberlain era got numbed early on to his astonishing might.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to those numbers two paragraphs up. In the 1961-62
season, he averaged slightly in excess of 50 points a game. Fifty.
Five-oh. Need I point out that nowadays, some teams are averaging
only 37 1/2 percent more than that? On March 2, 1962, he was 36 for
63 from the floor and 28 for 32 from the line while playing for the
Philly Warriors against the Knicks. That's 100 points! Let's see
how many NBA teams score 100 points on opening night. His numbers
read like some sort of basketball science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But as amazing as they are, forget the numbers for a minute.
Wilt was not merely an accumulator of statistics. The truth is he
was one of the handful of greatest athletes this country has ever
produced. He could run. He could jump. He was at home in a track
meet. At one point, there was an offer on the table to box. He was
a skilled volleyball player.
</P>
<P>
   And he was unfailingly human, which was always held against him.
For one thing, he was too damn nice. At 7 feet 1 inch (at least)
and 280 pounds (at least), and superbly coordinated (beyond
dispute), he could have hurt people. But in Wilt's mind, that was
simply not an option. He was decent on the court, and he was decent
off it. He lacked a killer instinct. Worse yet, he often came to
play with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, it wasn't a political agenda or a social agenda. It was a
stylistic agenda. Wilt quickly grew bored with his nightly low-post
demonstration of power and finesse. He wanted people to know he was
not just another basketball goon, he could also bring grace and
elegance to the game. Hence his ever-growing infatuation with a
long fadeaway banker.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a bad shot, either, but if you were Bill Russell, Nate
Thurmond, Johnny Kerr, or some other contemporary center of note,
would you prefer to see Wilt move menacingly toward the hoop or
take himself 20 feet from the basket with a banked fadeaway? Duh.
</P>
<P>
   Having mastered the physical landscape early in his career, Wilt
spent much of his final seven or eight years demonstrating to the
world he could do whatever he wanted to do. Except shoot free
throws, of course. But feed cutters? Hey, let's lead the league in
assists. How about allowing others to shine? Why, I'll just limit
myself to taps and dunks, and in so doing I'll lead the league in
field goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to strike the perfect balance once. In 1966-67, he
averaged 24 points, 24 rebounds, and 8 assists per game. It's
certainly possible it was the most effective year any center has
ever had, before or since. Not surprisingly, his team won the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of just two championships he would win, and it was
forever held against him that while he was busy setting all the
records, his friend and rival Bill Russell was assembling an
impressive ring collection in Boston. It was, and always will be,
impossible not to take sides in the great Wilt vs. Russ debate
because this speaks to the heart of being a sports fan. Wilt
couldn't win. In the public eye, he was Goliath and Russell was
David, and we all know the outcome of that particular PR battle.
</P>
<P>
   So Wilt had to settle for something else. While Russell lost
money in various business ventures and did some minor damage to his
basketball reputation with an indifferent coaching stint in
Sacramento, Wilt lived happily and famously large for the last 26
years of his life. For Wilt was smart. He was good with money. He
hardly ever did anything he didn't want to do, and if you read his
notorious autobiography, you know one thing he really liked to do.
</P>
<P>
   He was known to be a loyal and generous friend, and he could
expound on any number of topics. He was a very happy man.
</P>
<P>
   But he often came off as a bitter guy because he found everyone
other than Russell inferior to him as a player. He was very hard on
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, for example, and just plain merciless when
evaluating lesser mortals (He once proclaimed that his dogs could
guard Marvin Webster, for example). But he would never regard
himself as bitter. He wuld regard himself as being truthful. And
the truth is not solely his dogs, but very possibly his cats and
perhaps even his goldfish could have guarded Webster. Wilt never
could see the sense in avoiding what he considered to be the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's more truth. We didn't merely lose a unique basketball
force when we lost Wilt Chamberlain. We lost a fascinating
American. When it came to getting the most out of his life, Wilt
never settled for the fadeaway. He took it to the hoop every chance
he got.
