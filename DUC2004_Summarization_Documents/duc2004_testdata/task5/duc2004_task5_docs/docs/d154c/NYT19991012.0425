   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WILT the Stilt.
</P>
<P>
   He came before Hakeem the Dream, Chet the Jet, Earl the Pearl
and Clyde the Glide.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dipper.
</P>
<P>
   Before Air Jordan, the Human Highlight Film and Chocolate
Thunder, he was the reason to never take your eyes off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dr. J, Pistol Pete and Magic, he was the reason to come
to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Before Larry, Michael and Kobe, he needed only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Iceman, he invented cool.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Norman Chamberlain. As it said on the dust cover of his
first autobiography: ``Just like any other 7-foot black millionaire
who lives next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the debate will begin. It says here he was the greatest
player ever, and when the M.J. bunch comes around to offer its
rebuttal, just remember this:
</P>
<P>
   Every referee in the NBA was magically transformed into a blind
man with a cane each time Jordan would commit a walking violation
while driving to the hoop. They ignored one of the most fundamental
rules of the game for him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the NBA legislated multiple rule changes
designed specifically to stop Wilt. They widened the lane to move
him farther away from the basket. When he began to shoot free
throws by taking off from the foul line on a standing long jump,
they outlawed the move.
</P>
<P>
   Could he dominate today? Listen to Shaquille O'Neal, who wears a
Superman tattoo on his biceps, cry about the officiating. See how
Wilt just overwhelmed the game.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the numbers you already know, the 100 points in a
single game on March 2, 1962, or a 50.4 scoring average for the
1961-62 season. Remember that he once played every single minute _
including overtime _ of every single game for an entire season and
that he never fouled out of a game in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Russell camp will make its case with the usual evidence
of Russell's 11 championship rings to only two for Wilt. But
Russell's Celtics _ with the exception of the 1967 Philadelphia
76ers _ were consistently loaded with far more talent than the
various collections of Warriors, Sixers and Lakers that backed up
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   So much was made of the Wilt-vs.-Russell rivalry down through
the years. The talk of how Russell loved to rub his face in it. The
story of the time Wilt demanded a raise from the Warriors to
$100,000 per season so that he could be paid more than Russell,
only to find out later that Russell's deal with the Celtics called
for him to make one dollar more.
</P>
<P>
   But what never came out until years after they both retired was
how Russell, a loner from the West Coast who felt isolated in
Boston, ate so many Thanksgiving dinners at the Chamberlain house
in Philadelphia with Wilt's entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was always such an easy and conspicuous target, a
flamboyant black man who arrived on the scene to dominate what was
still a very white game in the conservative 1950s. He was easy for
opponents to dislike, simply because he was bigger than everybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cheers for Goliath,'' Wilt said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a giant on the court who was exceptionally fast and
extremely agile, yet powerfully strong. Wilt once broke up a fight
between teammate Al Attles and some of the New York Knicks by
reaching out with one long arm and picking Attles clear off the
floor by the waistband of his uniform shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that ever happened to the NBA is that God made
Wilt a nice man,'' said the late Jack McMahon, an All-Star for the
old Rochester Royals. ``He coulda killed us all with his left
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He fancied himself as something of a Renaissance man, hanging
out with everybody from movie stars to jockeys to race car drivers
to politicians. A high jumper, shot putter and cross country runner
at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and a Harlem Globetrotter
for one year after college, he said he wanted to try Formula One
racing and pro tennis, and he signed to get into the ring with
then-heavyweight champ Muhammad Ali in a fight that never came off.
He became the head coach of the San Diego Conquistadors of the old
ABA, then would miss practice.
</P>
<P>
   He'd play 48 minutes in a basketball game, use one towel to wipe
off the sweat and then put on his fancy clothes and hit the town.
No shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ladies want to get the essence of the real me,'' Wilt
said.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, in his second book, he claimed to have made love
to 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Big talk. Big man. Larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt the Stilt. The original.
