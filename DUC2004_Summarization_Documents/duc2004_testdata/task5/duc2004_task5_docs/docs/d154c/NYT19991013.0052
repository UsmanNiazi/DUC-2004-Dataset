Like most everyone else, members of the Rockets were shocked to
learn Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain, considered by many to be the
greatest NBA player ever, had died Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chamberlain died of an apparent heart attack at his home in Bel
Air, Calif., at the age of 63, stunning many in the basketball
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sad thing for me,'' said the Rockets' Charles
Barkley. ``I got to know him a little bit when I was with
Philadelphia, and he was always good to me. I was in awe of him
because of how physically big he was. Wilt was just one of those
bigger-than-life personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Chamberlain was large _ his stature, his
talent, his reputation, his accomplishments and his ego.
</P>
<P>
   But his numbers ultimately will define the 7-1, 285-pound
Chamberlain, and most of those numbers can still be found in the
NBA record book.
</P>
<P>
   The records are staggering _ most points in a game, 100; highest
single-season scoring average, 50.4; most points in a season,
4,029; highest single-season rebound average, 27.2; most rebounds
in a single game, 55; most games with 50 or more points, 118.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Larger-than-life numbers for a larger-than-life personality.
Most exhibit greatness in flashes, a single game or a stretch of
great play; Chamberlain exhibited a mind-numbing level of greatness
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   His talent was so overwhelming, the name ``Wilt Chamberlain''
soon became synonymous with big men, as a skinny youth from Lagos,
Nigeria, soon learned when he started playing the game of
basketball in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard of Wilt Chamberlain when I came here from
Nigeria,'' said Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon. ``Just that name _
Wilt Chamberlain. It was very distinctive. And that number _ 13
(Chamberlain's jersey number). It was also very distinctive. And
his accomplishments are distinctive, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see those numbers, and if somebody were just telling you
about it, if it wasn't part of history, you would deny it. You
would not think it is possible for someone to do what he did. To
score 50 points per game for a whole season? To score 100 in a
game? And 55 rebounds in a game? That's impossible. I cannot
imagine such things. If it was possible, I would just like to watch
the game and see how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things will never happen again, and that is what defines
his greatness. The standard has been set and will never be
equaled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain dominated almost everything he tackled, be it a
basketball game or a debate. But mostly he dominated basketball.
Chamberlain led the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers to a 68-13
regular-season record, going on to capture the NBA title, the first
for Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   He later did those Sixers one better, leading the 1971-72 Lakers
to a 69-13 regular-season record, going on to beat the New York
Knicks for his second NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Michael Jordan, Wilt was the greatest player who
ever lived,'' Barkley said. ``Just look at the numbers and the
things he did during his career that will never be equaled. I don't
think we really have an appreciation for what he accomplished,
because people never really got to see him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we judge great accomplishments by what won't be done
again, and Wilt did a lot of things that won't ever be done again.
He scored 100 points in a game, he averaged 50 points for a season,
he got 55 rebounds in a game _ these things are unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his retirement in 1973, Chamberlain would win seven
straight scoring titles, 11 rebounding crowns and four Most
Valuable Player awards along with his two titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Wilt Chamberlain was one of the greatest basketball
players of all time,'' said former Rocket Elvin Hayes. ``He did
whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted on the court. If you said,
`Wilt, you can't lead the league in scoring,' he'd go out and do
it. And if you said, `Wilt, you can't lead the league in assists,'
he'd go out and do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of player who could do whatever he wanted to
on the court. That's why this (his death) is so shocking. He was
always so strong and healthy-looking. When you talk about great
basketball, some people still think of Wilt Chamberlain and Bill
Russell, and I don't know if that will ever change.''
