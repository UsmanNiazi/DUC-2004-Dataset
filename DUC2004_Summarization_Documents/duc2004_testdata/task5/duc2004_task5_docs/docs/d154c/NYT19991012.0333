   The Good-Natured Goliath
</P>
<P>
   If you ever were around Wilt Chamberlain up close, you had to
believe he might someday be the world's oldest living person. Maybe
nobody has ever been that big, that strong, and in that good shape.
For him to die suddenly at age 63, of a heart attack, well, you
just never thought anybody or anything would dare attack him.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the basketball court ever did.
</P>
<P>
   He once said, ``Nobody loves Goliath,'' but he was a
good-natured Goliath. In the 1970 National Basketball Association
finals, he was falling back on defense when Knicks guard Dick
Barnett tripped. While keeping his eyes on the ball, the 7-foot
275-pound Laker center reached out with his right arm and, to
prevent Barnett from falling, cradled him in mid-air as if he were
a child.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently thinking Wilt was holding him on purpose, Barnett
pumped his legs and swung his arms in frustration. With his eyes
still on the ball, Wilt gently restored Barnett to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   As big and strong as Wilt was, if he had been mean and nasty, he
would have been frightening, but he was never really belligerent.
Brutal sometimes, if only by accident, but never belligerent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt scored 100 points in a game for the Philadelphia Warriors
against the Knicks in Hershey, Pa. on March 2, 1962 when some NBA
teams still played a few home games in small nearby cities. That
same season he averaged 50.4 points a game. Averaged.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt once grabbed 55 rebounds in a game against the Celtics in
the Boston Garden. Some centers now don't get 55 rebounds in five
games, but Wilt got them against Bill Russell, the Celtics'
spider-armed center, who remembers that game only too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw every one of those 55 rebounds,'' Russell has cackled.
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw Chamberlain and Russell will always argue who was
better. For team value, Russell was the center of gravity in the
Celtic dynasty: 11 NBA championships in 13 seasons, from 1957 to
1969. For sheer individual dominance, Chamberlain was incomparable;
he also dominated two championship teams, the 1967 Philadelphia
76ers and the 1972 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt had flaws. Although he hit 28 of 32 free throws in his
100-point game, later in his 14-year career his free-throw
percentage once dipped as low as .380. At the foul line he simply
appeared psyched out. When he was criticized for shooting too much,
he sometimes preferred to pass the ball rather than shoot just to
prove he wasn't a ball hog.
</P>
<P>
   He lived as large as he was. Never married, he claimed in his
autobiography that he had made love with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   For all his fame in basketball, his private passion was
volleyball. He once hoped to be allowed to try out for the U.S.
Olympic volleyball team, but in those years his status as a pro
basketball player made him ineligible for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, more than a quarter of a century after he stopped
playing basketball, the NBA has never had a player quite like him.
Nobody that big and that strong.
</P>
<P>
   Several years after Wilt stopped playing, he toyed with the idea
of a comeback. On the day he visited the Knicks' offices in Madison
Square Garden, he talked to Red Holzman, then strode out to the
elevator. When it opened, two deliverymen were struggling with a
dolly piled high with boxes of office supplies, mostly letterheads
and envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   The load was so heavy, the elevator had stopped maybe four
inches below the floor level and now the deliverymen were huffing
and puffing, but they couldn't raise the dolly high enough to get
it on the floor level.
</P>
<P>
   After maybe two minutes of the deliverymen's huffing and
puffing, Wilt, his biceps bulging in a tank top, peered down at
them and intoned, ``Gentlemen, maybe I can help.'' They stepped
back, he stepped into the elevator, grabbed each end of the rope
slung under the dolly and without much exertion, quickly lifted the
dolly onto the floor level.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up in awe, the deliverymen said, ``Thank you.'' Wilt
said, ``You're welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilt stepped into the elevator and rode down to the street level
as another witness followed the two deliverymen toward the Knick
offices and asked, ``How much does all this weigh?'' They quickly
surveyed the stack of big boxes of office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to 600 pounds,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain had lifted that load only a few inches, but
those two husky deliverymen hadn't been able to budge it. He did it
as easily as he had once cradled Dick Barnett in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe nobody loved Goliath, but he was a good guy.
