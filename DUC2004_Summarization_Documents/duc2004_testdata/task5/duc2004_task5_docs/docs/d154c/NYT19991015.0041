WILT WAS NO GENTLE GIANT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Wilt Chamberlain was a test for a sportswriter. If you could
experience his mix of bombast, opinion and over-the-top joie de
vivre and not walk away smiling, it was time to turn in the old
press shield and explore that career in bartending.
<P>
   You didn't interview Wilt, he interviewed you. And did he ever
speak in anything but full-volume thunder? You'd have to ask one of
his 20,000 dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``L-l-let me ask you this, my man,'' he would say with his
authoritative stutter. ``How often do you think B-b-bill Russell
guarded me straight-up, without the help of at least two other
guys?''
</P>
<P>
   I became a Wilt Chamberlain fan at age 8 when I saw him play for
the Harlem Globetrotters, and I remained an unabashed Wilt fan
until the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   The great sports debate was always: Who's better _ Wilt or
Russell?
</P>
<P>
   L-l-let me tell you this: Wilt waxed Russell's butt up one side
and down the other.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilt waxed life's butt. At 60, he told me he was taking up
mountain biking. Great way to meet girls. And to scare mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt would hop in his car on a whim and drive cross-country,
trying to break his own record, stopping only to autograph speeding
tickets. He claimed to be a gourmet cook. He wrote two books with
no ghostwriter. He designed his own cathedral-like mansion. He
traveled the world, lived on a mountaintop in L.A. and on a beach
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   One day he told me he was designing and producing his own
limited-edition, high-performance car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wiltmobile!'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' he frowned. ``The Chamberlain.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he mentioned he was considering marriage, what did I think?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' I said, ``but I don't think it's for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilt settling down would have been like the Titanic settling
down.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the girls. The stories were true. Wilt took care of 20,000
babes, all right. More.
</P>
<P>
   He made it possible for at least that many women to participate
in high-level athletics. Wilt had six sisters, and he hated that
they had no opportunity to play sports. When he traveled to Russia
with the Globetrotters he was amazed at the athletic programs for
females, and he vowed to make that happen here.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. He organized, bankrolled, encouraged and sometimes
coached top amateur track, volleyball and basketball teams, and
promoted road races and marathons. In that sense, he really was
God's gift to women.
</P>
<P>
   And to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ASK FOR IT at your newsstand by its new name: ``SUCKcess.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Keating notes that ``Success'' magazine has filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's cover story: ``Are we all too hung up on this
material wealth stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO can't seem to do anything to slow down the drug
pushers. The shopping-cart pushers, that's another story. We got
'em sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown says he never intended to send his cops out
to snatch back the shopping carts used by homeless folks. But that
was  &UR; somebody's  &LR; plan, somebody high-high up in city authority.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to whoever issued that order: Please introduce yourself to
the mayor ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA'S VERSION of surf 'n' turf? Michael Thurston, a San
Francisco-based salesman, found it on the menu in Sydney _
crocodile and kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring me the reptile 'n' rodent,'' Thurston told his waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston's review: ``Wasn't very expensive. Wasn't very good,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Waiter, bring me the suitcase 'n' pouch. Or is it the &LR; 
 &UR; swamp 'n' stomp? Ah, make it a braised bandicoot, and hold the &LR; 
 &UR; young'un.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HONEST, THE ABE LINCOLN knew what it was doing when it steamed
under the Golden Gate Bridge last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The massive aircraft carrier almost skimmed the underside of the
bridge. My inside source said it was pure luck, that nobody had
bothered to calculate the clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did in fact calculate the air draft clearance,'' says
Captain Bruce Horton, the harbor pilot who guided the Abe into the
Bay, ``and when I got to the bridge of the ship, the captain had
also figured it out. To be exact, we had 27.9 feet of clearance. So
much for pure chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Great, Cap'n Horton, but doesn't all that mathematical
rigamarole take all the spontaneous fun out of boating?
