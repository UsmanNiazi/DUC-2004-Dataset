<HEADLINE> White House Denies Clark Forced Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The White House denied
Wednesday that an early outgoing of U.S. General Wesley Clark as
NATO commander is because of the way he handles the air campaign
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Clark is a superb commander. The president has the
highest degree of confidence in him," Sandy Berger, President Bill
Clinton's national security adviser, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"He did a superb job in the prosecution of the campaign in
Kosovo. Witness the fact that we won," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports had said that Clark would be forced to step down in
April next year, three months earlier before he completed his
term.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted several U.S. administration
and military officials as saying that Clark had rifts with the
Clinton administration during the 78-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
Clark argued "strenuously" that the option of using ground
troops in Kosovo not be removed from the table and he chafed at
the graduated air campaign dictated by the 19-member NATO
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified officials also said that Clark was not
particularly close to Defense Secretary William Cohen and the two
often communicated through an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported in its Wednesday edition that the
timing of Clark's departure had been dictated by a desire to move
Air Force General Joseph Ralston into the NATO job.
