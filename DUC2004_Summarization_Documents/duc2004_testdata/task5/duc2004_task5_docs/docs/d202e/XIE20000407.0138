<HEADLINE> Chirac Meets With NATO Commander in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday met here with the NATO Supreme Commander in Europe, General
Wesley Clark, who is on a visit in the French capital.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace did not give any details on the
talks between Chirac and Clark, who commanded the NATO air bombing
operation against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
Clark is due to be replaced by another U.S. general, Joseph W.
Ralston, at the end of this month as the chief of the NATO
commander in Europe based in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with French Defense Minister Alain
Richard, said the French Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A heavy security was imposed in Paris upon the arrival of Clark,
apparently because of the strong pro-Serb sentiment in France.
