<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects NATO Comment on Its Military Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry on
Thursday rejected NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley
Clark's criticism of its military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
"Wesley Clarke seems to have read that document inattentively,
or else he had an incorrect translation," said Valery Manilov,
first deputy head of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff.
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to the former Soviet republic of Lithuania,
Clarke said the new Russian military doctrine focuses on the
protection of its own interests to the detriment of partnership.
</P>
<P>
Manilov, however, refuted Clarke's assertion.
</P>
<P>
"Partnership occupies a pivotal place in the new doctrine.
Maybe Mr. Clarke understands this term in his own way," the
Interfax news agency quoted Manilov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The doctrine calls for partnership and for efforts to be made
to forestall war and settle conflicts "without using force or
resorting to military means", he said.
</P>
<P>
Manilov also criticized NATO's latest strategic conception,
saying the alliance divides its partners into two types: "first
class" and" second class."
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable to Russia, which calls for an equal and
comprehensive security system to be created," he said.
