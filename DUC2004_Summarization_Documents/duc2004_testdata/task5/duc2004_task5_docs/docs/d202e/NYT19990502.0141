HIS FAMILY'S PAST IS SAID TO WEIGH ON NATO'S COMMANDER

   WASHINGTON _ The American general who is leading NATO's military
operation to stop Yugoslav troops from killing and expelling
Albanians from Kosovo discovered as an adult that he is the
grandson of a Russian Jew who fled his country to escape the
pogroms there a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Kanne Clark was raised as a Protestant in Little
Rock, Ark., where he was brought up by his mother and stepfather,
Victor Clark. He was ignorant of his ancestry, which disappeared
from his life with the death of his father, Benjamin Jacob Kanne
when Wesley was 5. He learned of his ethnic background when he was
in his 20s and embraced the discovery, according to several family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began the forced
exodus of Albanians from Kosovo, many have drawn parallels with the
expulsion of Jews from Russia and the Nazi mass murder of Jews
during the Holocaust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has not discussed his heritage with many people, sharing
his belated discovery of his biological father's family and
background with only a few close friends and his immediate family.
He declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, some of his relatives and friends say that
Clark was inspired by the story of his grandfather's persecution
and escape from his native land, and that his determination to
defeat Milosevic is fed in part by his empathy for the victims of
Serbian ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   After he was married, while studying at Oxford from 1966 to
1968, Wesley Clark was contacted by his father's relatives and
gradually became aware of who his father and grandparents were.
Soon after, he met some of the members of his lost family. He then
slowly became part of the Kanne family, beginning with the initial
phone call from a cousin in the late 1960s and culminating with an
invitation to his first cousin Barry Kanne to spend a quiet New
Year dinner with him in Belgium this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also has become fluent in the Russian language and in the
past three years has delved into the family history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's visited my mother several times in the past two years to
find out what he could about his father and grandfather _ she is
the oldest living relative and the repository of the family
history,'' said Barry Kanne, the general's first cousin and the son
of Benjamin Kanne's only brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1890s, Jacob Nemerovsky, the general's grandfather,
fled Russia in fear for his life during one of the episodic pogroms
against Jews. According to the family, Nemerovsky found safety in
Switzerland where he obtained a false passport under the family
name of Kanne, which he used to immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes and I talked about his family once on a military plane to
Bosnia,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the negotiator of the Dayton
peace plan. ``I told him how my wife discovered she was Jewish in
her 30s and he said, `That's funny, I have a sort of similar
story.'''
</P>
<P>
   (Another Clinton administration official, Madeleine Albright,
learned only after she was nominated as secretary of state that her
grandparents had died in concentration camps during the Holocaust.)
</P>
<P>
   The Kanne family say they believe that Clark has, in the Balkans
crisis, called on discipline and motivation that reminds them of
his father. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the retired chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and a confidant of Clark's, says that the
general has been under ``unbelievable stress'' as the Kosovo air
campaign has expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark has an infinite capacity for hard work and stress,''
Shalikashvili said. ``That's a characteristic of his _ he devotes
all of his energies to get the job done and done right.''
</P>
<P>
   These were also characteristics of his father B.J. Kanne, who in
a grainy 1927 newspaper photograph bears a remarkable resemblance
to the man commanding the biggest European conflict since World War
II. His father had made the news for resigning from his position as
assistant prosecuting attorney in Chicago that year in order to
``devote his entire time'' to run for election as alderman of the
Fourth Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very active in politics in Chicago, and a University of
Chicago graduate,'' said Harriet Salk, an older cousin of Clark who
lives in a suburb outside the city. ``And what a tall, good-looking
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers that handsome uncle from the family gatherings
every Friday night _ the beginning of Sabbath _ and again on Sunday
evening at the home of Grandmother Kanne, the widow of Jacob. The
family is not sure, but they believe she, too, fled Russia, coming
to America with Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   The general's father, who served as a Navy ensign during World
War I, practiced law in Chicago's corporation counsel for 20 years
and had joined a private firm with his brother Louis when he died
suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 51. He left behind his
widow, Veneta Kanne, and a lone son, Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, Mrs. Salk said, ``the constituents were lined up
for blocks to pay their respects to Wesley's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterwards, the young Wesley Clark moved with his mother to
her hometown of Little Rock, far away from the close knit Chicago
family of his hard-driving, ambitious father.
</P>
<P>
   His mother remarried Victor Clark, who adopted Wesley and gave
him his name, and thereafter the Kanne family learned of the
accomplishments of B.J.'s son from a distance. Florence Ellis, one
of the five sisters of B.J. Kanne, kept up a private correspondence
with Veneta Kanne Clark, and passed on the letters about Wesley to
the rest of the Kanne family.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As Wesley K. Clark graduated first in his high school class,
then first in his class at West Point, the family heaped praise on
Veneta for raising him so well and also avoided any direct contact
with Wesley out of respect for Veneta's new life, according to
cousin Barry Kanne.
</P>
<P>
   Then when Wesley Clark was attending Oxford as a Rhodes scholar,
one of the cousins, Molly Friedman from Cleveland, was visiting
England and called Wesley at the university. At that point Clark
didn't even know why he had the unusual middle name of Kanne, much
less who his real father or grandfather were, according to the
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a master's degree, Clark left Oxford to fight in
Vietnam, where he commanded a mechanized infantry company, was
wounded four times and received the Silver Star and Purple Heart
awards.
</P>
<P>
   He also converted to Roman Catholicism in Vietnam, abandoning
the Southern Baptist faith of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, Clark had few contacts with the Kanne
family as he climbed up the military ranks and began to build his
strong political network, beginning with his appointment as a White
House fellow immediately after the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, however, Barry Kanne's daughter April introduced
herself to Clark's son, Wesley, Jr., when they were both studying
at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked him up and he had already heard a lot of the stories
at that point,'' said April Kanne Donnellan. ``After that I spent a
couple of Christmases at General Clark's home at Fort McNair.''
</P>
<P>
   Through their children's contacts, Clark finally met Barry
Kanne, his first cousin and the only other direct male descendant
of Jacob Nemorovsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was this contact about five years ago that led Clark to
embark on a more thorough search into his father's family. ``He
knew a moderate amount about the family when I met him,'' said
Barry Kanne. ``He was trying to fill in the gaps so I pointed him
towards Mom and he's visited her several times.''
