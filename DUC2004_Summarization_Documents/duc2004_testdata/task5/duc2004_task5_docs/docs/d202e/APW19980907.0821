NATO Gen. Wesley Clark visits Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's
supreme commander for Europe, discussed plans for NATO enlargement
and the situation in the Balkans with his Slovene hosts on Monday.
	   Slovenia is in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. It was
excluded from the first round of NATO expansion this year, with
U.S. assurances its future membership will be considered.
	   The most prosperous of former Yugoslav republics and the closest
to Western Europe, it is eager to be seen as a part of the West
rather than the Balkans.
	   Clark met Defense Minister Alojz Krapez and the army's chief of
staff, Iztok Predbregar. On Tuesday, he will meet President Milan
Kucan and premier Janez Drnovsek.
