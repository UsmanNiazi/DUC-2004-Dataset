	   CERKLJE, Slovenia (AP) _ NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, thanked Slovenia on Friday for hosting a
military maneuver that the alliance held for the first time in this
former Yugoslav country.
	   Clark arrived Friday for a one-day visit to observe the
operation, code-named Exercise Cooperative Adventure Exchange 1998.
	   The exercise closed later in the day. More than 5,500 troops
from the eight member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and 10 nations of the Alliance's Partnership for Peace
program were participating in the operation.
	   Slovenia became a member of the Partnership for Peace soon after
it proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslav federation in
1991. It hopes to be invited to join the Alliance in the next round
of expansion. In summer of 1997 Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic were invited to join NATO.
	   Up to 1,200 Slovene soldiers participated in the exercise, which
was aimed as a rehearse for peace support operation.
	   Clark said the exercise was productive and conducted well.
	   Slovenes now expect traffic jams as more than 3,500 NATO
vehicles and thousands of troops from across Europe pull out from
its territory.
