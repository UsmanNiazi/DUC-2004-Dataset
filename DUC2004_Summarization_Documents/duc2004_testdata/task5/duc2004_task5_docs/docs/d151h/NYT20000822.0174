   Henry Johnsen is a retired college professor living in Dunedin,
Fla. Hoyt Brown is an ex-General Electric factory worker who day
trades stocks from his Armuchee, Ga., home. Pete McDade is a
Florida aerospace engineer. Although a diverse group, the three
have a couple of things they share. They've all lost money in the
market this year. And they all know exactly who's to blame: Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a dream wrecker, that Greenspan,'' Johnsen snarls. ``He
wants us all to work at McDonald's until we are 72.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is full of it,'' Brown complains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a putz,'' says McDade. ``A wrinkled-up prune of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan _ whose official response to that kind of criticism is
a polite ``no comment'' _ can take comfort in the fact that most
people think he's doing a good job. Yet Johnsen, Brown and McDade
belong to a growing (and highly vocal) minority of individual
investors who truly detest him. They don't understand why Greenspan
fears inflation; they think he's overreacting to the so-called
wealth effect caused by rising asset prices; and most of all, they
are furious about what his latest interest-rate hikes have done to
their tech-heavy stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of thing most Americans have gotten themselves
so worked up about in the past. As recently as the Fed's last
string of rate hikes in November 1994, the debate was very much
limited to Wall Street strategists. But this is a new era _ a time
when the once arcane and rarefied process of trading stocks has
been truly democratized. Now it seems as if everyone has a stake in
the argument. Forty-nine percent of Americans have some exposure,
direct or indirect, to the stock market. More important, though, is
the extent to which people have been buying stocks on their own.
Nineteen percent of American households own stock, up from 15
percent in 1995, all of them trying to grab a slice of the American
dream.
</P>
<P>
   For this new breed of investor, the latest rate hikes smack of a
hand that is all too visible. Henry Johnsen says he has phoned
Greenspan's office at least 50 times in search of an explanation.
The U.S. economy may have been growing at a rate of 7 percent a
year, but there is a second industrial revolution under way. ``I
want some answers. What is it he wants? A worldwide depression? Is
it in the Fed's charter to manufacture recessions? They talk about
a free market. Baloney. This market is controlled and manipulated
by Alan Greenspan.''
</P>
<P>
   At Greenspan's unofficial fan club Web site, GetExuberant.com,
chief groupie and site founder David Gallivan had to clear the
message board after a recent flood of anti-Greenspan chatter.
``There were just too many of them,'' he says. ``And they were
getting personal. Our members were getting intimidated.''
Long-standing Fed-basher Larry Kudlow, an economist with ING
Barings, reports a surge in support as well. Nine months ago he
would get 150 or so e-mails a week; now after one of his regular
appearances on CNBC, he gets as many as 800 in a week _ with nine
out of 10 written in support of his Alan-just-does-not-get-it
commentary. ``As far as the Alan Greenspan cult goes,'' Kudlow
says, ``the bloom is definitely off the rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaving through many stories of anti-Greenspan rage and
frustration is a clear us-versus-them mentality _ a pungent whiff
of class antagonism. There is no doubt that the stock market boom
of the '90s has made a lot of people very wealthy, but a good
two-thirds of that wealth remains in the hands of only 10 percent
of the population. The other 90 percent have been playing catch-up,
many with their life savings and retirement money. And now
Greenspan is taking it away from them. They feel violated. This is
not money they can afford to lose. Besides, they haven't lost
before; their only experience is with a bull market. ``I lose half
my net worth and there Greenspan is on TV talking about the wealth
effect,'' says Hoyt Brown, who has watched his retirement savings
of $88,000 dwindle to less than $30,000 this year. ``I'd like him
to tell me where that wealth effect is. ... I just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is more than a little cynical, too. ``Let me tell you, if you
don't think those guys at the Fed took advantage of these rate
hikes and made a little bit on the side, and told their
brother-in-law too, well, then you've just fallen off the turnip
truck,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's response? Equanimity. Indeed, in light of recent
soft economic data, the growing consensus is that for the time
being at least, Greenspan's work is all but done. ``It wouldn't be
the first time he got it right. Remember, this is the same man that
engineered the soft landing in 1994,'' says Lehman Brothers
economist Stephen Slifer, pointing to weak retail sales numbers as
a signal that the economy is now on the wane. ``There is no
evidence that we are going to go over a cliff'' and into a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   If Slifer is right, this groundswell of antagonism will probably
ease. After all, most investors loved Greenspan when their
portfolios enjoyed double-digit gains. But should the markets turn
genuinely bearish long enough to erode retirement savings, the
whiff of class warfare could become a stench. A generation of new
investors who have begun to look to the markets as the source of a
guaranteed annuity for their golden years will suddenly discover
this basic rule of investing: sometimes you win, sometimes you
lose.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the scapegoat for their disappointment was
Greenspan, against whom their rage is pretty much impotent. Next
time, they could just as easily turn their ire on a target who can
be hurt at the polls, someone who could be in a position to appoint
the next Greenspan. And if Social Security dollars wind up in the
market, there's no telling what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   For people like LaJuana Gilmore of Houston, the issue is far
from academic. A 61-year-old newly retired administrative
assistant, she is relying on her IRA to sustain her. Every day she
logs on to track the progress of her Putnam funds. So on March 25,
when the Nasdaq fell, she knew to a penny how much money she had
lost: $12,000, or 15 percent of her IRA _ about half of what she
needs to get by in a year. How could it be? And who was this Alan
Greenspan guy, anyway? ``Before this year, I'd never had any real
feelings about the man,'' she recounts. ``But then he started
raising rates, and my funds just went crazy. I mean, who does he
think he is? God?''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore searched the Internet for Greenspan's e-mail address but
couldn't find it. What she did find, though, was a site _ Alan
Greenspan's Dreambook _ where posters could display whatever
messages they might have for the chairman. She wasn't sure if her
note would get to him, but she figured she had nothing to lose.
``Mr. Greenspan,'' she wrote. ``Inflation is not killing me, but
your messing with the interest rates is. Maybe you need to retire
and turn the reins over to someone who understands that we need our
retirement money to grow. A worried person on disability, LaJuana
Gilmore.''
