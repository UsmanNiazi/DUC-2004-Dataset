<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Robbers Pose Y2K Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is not  
worried that the world's financial markets will come crashing down 
because of the Year 2000 computer problem. His fear is more basic -- 
a rash of robberies spawned by people keeping too much cash lying 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to a Chicago audience, Greenspan worried that the  
news media will so dramatize the dangers of computer system 
meltdowns on Jan. 1, 2000, that the fears will affect the real 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the evening news is going to play it as though we are  
looking at an asteroid which is about to hit us,'' said Greenspan, 
who is married to NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he is concerned that people will become  
vulnerable to robbers who see an opportunity to get their hands 
``on real cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, he said, Americans should see through any media hype  
and realize there will be no major breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that people will get very wise very soon and  
recognize that the last thing you want to do is draw inordinate 
amounts of currency out of the banks,'' Greenspan said. ``The 
safest thing to do is to keep your money in the bank where it is 
going to be the safest.''
