   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday he would nominate
Alan Greenspan to a fourth four-year term as chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the White House after meeting
in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning with Greenspan, whose
inflation-fighting efforts are widely credited with providing the
foundation for the long economic expansion and the record-setting
bull market on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, a conservative Republican who was first appointed to
the post by President Reagan in 1987, has won support from across
the political spectrum for his deft touch in keeping the economy on
track. Members of both parties said there is no question that his
nomination will be approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, 73, has made no secret of his desire to stay on, and
Tuesday's news was a surprise only in that it came so far in
advance of the expiration of his term of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had to persuade Greenspan to accept another term,
Clinton responded, ``No. I asked him and he said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed chairman standing at his side, Clinton praised
Greenspan for his role in nurturing an expansion that next month
will become the longest in the nation's history, with all the
benefits it has brought in low unemployment, rising wages and
reduced welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large
role in our strong economy,'' Clinton said. ``That is why today I
am pleased to announce my decision to renominate Alan Greenspan as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Greenspan's ``wise and steady leadership has
inspired confidence, not only here in America but all around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan in turn warmly praised Clinton and his economic team,
with whom he has worked closely in overhauling the nation's banking
laws, containing the global financial crisis that rocked Asia
several years ago and monitoring the rapid changes that technology
has brought to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he had enjoyed every minute of the job, and
suggested his enthusiasm for it was undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been an extraordinary challenge, and especially
for an economist who likes to get into the nitty-gritty of every
statistic you've ever seen,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter to comment on the stock market, Greenspan
reverted to his usual silence, declining to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had dropped broad hints last year that he would like to
reappoint Greenspan. Vice President Al Gore has been a strong
backer of reappointing Greenspan, as have Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
and his chief rival in the Republican primaries, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's reappointment was also sure to be welcomed on Wall
Street, which at times has been exasperated by the Fed chairman's
suggestions that stock prices are overvalued but has profited
enormously from the climate of low inflation and steady growth that
he has helped to create.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's announcement did little to help stocks Tuesday.
Prices fell sharply on Wall Street throughout the morning, in part
because of expectations that Greenspan would raise interest rates
next month to slow the economy and prevent a buildup of
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   By reappointing Greenspan well before his term expired, Clinton
seemed to be trying to stick to his administration's strategy of
insulating the Fed from politics as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is all but certain to raise interest rates in coming
months, and might have to engineer a series of rate increases as
the election year progresses if the economy does not slow, analysts
said. And although Gore, Bush and McCain all support Greenspan, the
Fed chairman has come under criticism on the Republican side from
Steve Forbes, who says Greenspan is too quick to assume that strong
growth will generate inflation. And Greenspan has gotten only
lukewarm support from former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's chief rival
for the Democratic nomination.
