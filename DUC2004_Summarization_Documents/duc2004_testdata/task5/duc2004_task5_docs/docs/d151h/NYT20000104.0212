   WASHINGTON _ With the nation poised to enter the longest period
of economic expansion in US history, President Clinton extended the
job Tuesday of the man he credits with guiding the economic
success: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Greenspan has displayed ``a rare combination of
technical expertise, sophisticated analysis and old-fashioned
common sense,'' Clinton said as he nominated Greenspan, as
expected, to a fourth, four-year term. ``His wise and steady
leadership has inspired confidence, not only here in America but
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city whose fabled motto is ``if you want a friend in
Washington, get a dog,'' Greenspan is almost universally liked and
respected. The Senate has approved Greenspan's nomination eagerly
in the past and is expected to confirm the pending renomination
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about taking `alan.com' public; then we
could pay the debt off even before 2015,'' Clinton quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the challenge of applying theories to the
marketplace discouraged him from taking retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like eating peanuts. You keep doing it, keep doing it,
and you never get tired, because the future is always unknowable,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Fed, Greenspan and the Fed board are
responsible for setting interest rates that affect homebuyers.
Since interest rates are a key factor in the performance of the
stock market, stockholders are also affected by Greenspan's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   About half of American households have some connection to the
stock market, either because people trade on the market or have
pension funds that are invested in mutual funds, said Rosanne Cahn,
chief equities economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market Tuesday fell 359 points, a dramatic drop. But
the decline in the Dow was ``not an adverse reaction to Alan
Greenspan's reappointment,'' said Frederick Breimyer, chief
economist for State Street Bank and Trust in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was mainly due to expectations that the Fed will raise
interest rates in February, Breimyer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plunge in the stock market on the day of the
Greenspan announcement ``also says his reappointment itself is not
going to send the stock market up, either,'' Breimyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill praised
Clinton's decision to renominate Greenspan, who has served for 12
years under the administrations of Presidents Reagan, Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard nothing from my colleagues, which would indicate
that there would be any problem with his Senate confirmation,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is also fond of the man who has presided over a
remarkable era of economic growth. While fiscal analysts give
Greenspan credit for adjusting interest rates appropriately to keep
the economy humming, they note he has also benefited from being in
the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the president of the United States, he gets credit
when it's good, and blame if it's bad,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The country is in its longest peacetime expansion, and in a few
weeks, will be in its longest period of growth ever, according to
forecasts by the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is 4.1 percent, the lowest in 30 years, and the
federal deficit is on track to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's renomination lends a sense of stability not only to
the financial services industry, but also to the presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidates' economic plans have largely been based
on the presumption that the economy will continue to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Economists do not believe that the nation will enter a recession
this year, Cahn and others said, but naturally there are no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Greenspan, the presidential candidates are
almost entirely _ and uncharacteristically _ in agreement. And the
performance of the bespectacled, unassuming man could have an
enormous impact on the outcome of the election, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans George W. Bush, the Texas governor, and Senator John
McCain of Arizona back the Fed chairman, as do the Democratic
contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long urged President Clinton to reappoint Alan
Greenspan, and so I applaud the decision'' Bush said in a
statement. ``Chairman Greenspan's strong leadership is good for the
country and good for our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has already committed to Greenspan. ``I would not only
reappoint Mr. Greenspan,'' McCain joked during a New Hampshire
debate in December, ``if Mr. Greenspan were to die, God forbid, I
would do like the movie `Weekend at Bernie's' and stuff him and
prop him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Steve Forbes has expressed misgivings about
Greenspan, saying he would have a ``heart-to-heart'' talk with the
Fed chairman about his economic policies before considering
renominating him.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Greenspan's performance at the Fed could be
critical. If the economy takes a dive, Democrats could no longer
boast about their party's performance on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's ambitious health-care plan ``would bankrupt the
country unless the economy continues to be strong,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, would suffer by his personal association with
the administration in power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore were elected in 1992 in large part because
unemployment was more than 7 percent, noted Jeff Faux, president of
the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `the economy, stupid' then, and it's `the economy,
stupid' now,'' said Faux, referring to a Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prosperity does go down, the Republicans' chances of
electing a president go up,'' Faux said. ``But for the Democrats,
their future relies on the economy and, to some degree, what
Greenspan is going to do.''
