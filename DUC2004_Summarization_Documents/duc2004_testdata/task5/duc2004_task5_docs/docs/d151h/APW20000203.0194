<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Greenspan for 4th Term  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hailed as the "greatest central banker in the history of
the world," Alan Greenspan overwhelmingly won confirmation Thursday for a fourth
term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 89-4 to approve President Clinton's nomination of the
Republican Greenspan, 73, for a four-year term that will run until June 2004.
</P>
<P>
   His confirmation came one day after the Federal Reserve voted to boost a key
interest rate for a fourth time since June in an effort to slow down the U.S.
economy down and keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was first nominated to the Fed job, often called the second most
powerful in the country because of the central bank's control over interest
rates, by Ronald Reagan in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently was nominated for three more four-year terms -- once by
George Bush in 1992 and twice by Clinton, first in 1996 and then again in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to nominate Greenspan again was widely expected. It was
unlikely a Democratic president could have gotten anyone else confirmed by the
Republican-controlled Senate so close to the end of the presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate vote, Clinton said in a statement that "Greenspan's wise
and steady leadership has inspired confidence here in American and around the
world. ... He has made a truly remarkable contribution in helping lead our
nation to the longest economic expansion in our history."
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's Senate supporters also cited the current 107-month economic
expansion, which this week became the longest in U.S. history, as evidence
Greenspan's tenure has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   "I believe a strong case can be made that Alan Greenspan is the greatest
central banker in the history of the world," said Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, citing various economic statistics, from the low
unemployment rate to the soaring stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The small group of liberal Democratic senators who opposed Greenspan's
nomination complained about the Fed rate increase, announced just as the Senate
debate began Wednesday. They said the rise was evidence Greenspan has been
overly worried about inflation at the expense of average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan called the rate increases "a tax on every single American
citizen" while Sen. Tom Harkin said of the four quarter-point increases since
June: "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding
pretty badly."
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dorgan, D-N.D., and Harkin, D-Iowa, the other two senators
voting against Greenspan's nomination were Democrats Harry Reid of Nevada and
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Clinton said he hoped the Senate would "move quickly" to confirm
his other two pending nominations to the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Clinton nominated Carol Parry, a former executive at Chase
Manhattan Bank, to fill a vacancy on the seven-member Fed board that has existed
since June 1998, when Susan Phillips resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also also nominated current Fed vice chairman, Roger Ferguson, to a
full 14-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm told reporters Wednesday he wanted to exercise special care in a
presidential election year in approving nominations for terms as long as the 14
years that a Fed board member serves.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ferguson's current term as a board member expired at the end of
January, he can continue serving on the board until Clinton or another president
nominates a successor who is confirmed by the Senate.
