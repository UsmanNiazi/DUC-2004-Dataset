	   Reactions to Alan Greenspan's appointment to a fourth term as chairman of
the Federal Reserve:
</P>
<P>
   "I feel a key player in this period of economic prosperity has been Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. I am confident that Chairman Greenspan's
technical experience, common sense and commitment to fiscal discipline will
continue to expand our nation's prosperity for all Americans." -- Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
   "He's a nice man but I would prefer new and different leadership at the
Fed." -- Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
   "I welcome the appointment of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to
another term. He has served with a steady hand as the spirit and ingenuity of
the American people have brought forth unprecedented economic prosperity. I have
heard nothing from my colleagues which would indicate that there would be any
problem with his Senate confirmation." -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
   "The president has made a wise and timely decision. It underscores that the
country has been well served by an independent, nonpartisan Federal Reserve." --
Rep. James A. Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking and Financial
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   "There's a basic rule in business: Don't mess with success. That's why the
reappointment of Alan Greenspan is such welcome news. Chairman Greenspan has
provided thoughtful, forward-looking and very prudent leadership as head of the
Federal Reserve, and his continued stewardship of the nation's monetary system
bodes well for continued noninflationary economic growth." -- Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   "Chairman Greenspan believes strongly in lower taxes, less government
spending, paying down the debt and creating jobs at home by expanding trade
overseas -- the four pillars of our economic plan to keep America strong. His
leadership has helped to free the energy, creativity and productivity of the
American worker which has brought us unprecedented economic growth." -- Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
  "His relentless pursuit of price stability is one of the key factors behind
the robust economic growth we are experiencing today. Since Alan Greenspan has
chaired the Federal Reserve, inflation and unemployment are both down nearly 2
percentage points, interest rates are down 2.5 percentage points, the Dow is up
325 percent and the economy has grown at a 3.2 percent annual rate." -- Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
   "The chairman, more than any other single individual, has aided in reducing
unemployment and inflation at the same time for over seven years, a feat unheard
of in many circles until his tenure. The Fed's chief duty is price stability and
inflation control. Alan Greenspan has done that and done it well." Rep. Jim
Saxton, R-N.J., vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   "With this announcement, President Clinton has taken a necessary step to
ensure that the Federal Reserve remains independent and will not be subject to
the pressures that could arise in the heat of an election year. I hope that the
Senate will approve this nomination at the earliest opportunity." -- House
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   "I strongly support the reappointment of Alan Greenspan. He's been good for
the markets and instrumental in helping resolve the Asian financial crisis." --
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   "Now that Chairman Greenspan has achieved renomination with acclamation, he
hopefully will be less timid toward the robust U.S. economy. Federal Reserve
policy can and should work to limit real interest rates, allowing economic
growth without another series of rate hikes or threats of hikes that are
detrimental to hard-working American families." -- Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn. and
a member of the Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   "I have long urged President Clinton to reappoint Alan Greenspan, and so I
applaud the decision. Chairman Greenspan's steady leadership is good for the
country and good for our economy." -- Republican presidential candidate Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
