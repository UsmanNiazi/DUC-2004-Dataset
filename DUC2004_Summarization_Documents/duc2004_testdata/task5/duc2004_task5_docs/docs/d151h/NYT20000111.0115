   We cannot praise Alan Greenspan enough. The accolades poured
forth again last week after President Clinton reappointed the
chairman of the Federal Reserve to another four-year term. On the
following days, the Fed chief was described variously as a
magician, a king, a saint, a god, and the reigning Hiram, Ohio,
spelling bee champion.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that Greenspan's accomplishments lift him above
the average mortal. He is credited with rescuing the global economy
from a series of potentially disastrous meltdowns, sustaining the
longest economic expansion in U.S. history, propelling the greatest
bull market ever seen and, where NASA has failed miserably, he has
been able to tune into the frequency of the lost Mars probe on his
dental bridgework.
</P>
<P>
   But we only know what we see of this exceptional man. He has the
grave presence of the central banker. He speaks in sober language
of fund rates and basis points. He favors staid suits, tasseled
loafers, humdrum eyeglasses and, at bedtime, is partial to
irrationally exuberant pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Alan Greenspan, really?
</P>
<P>
   We've rummaged around in his closet, rifled through his
briefcase, inspected his trash, and verified that he is, in fact,
Walter Matthau.Our research has uncovered many fascinating nuggets
of previously unknown biographical information, including a
detailed account of his days in the Symbionese Liberation Army
fighting for floating exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Early in life, Alan set his heart on a career as a central
banker. When he was as young as 8, he took a personal interest in
our nation's long-term economic growth. Deaf to his mother's
protests, little Alan would lock himself gloomily in his bedroom
whenever the benchmark 30-year bond moved above 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother reminded the boy that inflation was well under
control and that the gross domestic product was still expanding at
the same rate as the universe, Alan would reluctantly agree to go
outside like other children and sit under an old oak and calculate
the square root of the corn puffs in the Kix box.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenspan name has a curious history. Like many immigrants,
Alan Greenspan's ancestors washed onto New York's shores from a
distant land, bearing a name that was unpronounceable by the
American tongue. The officer on duty, who happened to have lunched
on canned meat that day and as a result had a terrible stomach
ache, gave the huddled family a name of his own making: Greenspam.
Needless to say, the Greenspan name might never have become
synonymous with brilliance had Alan's parents not legally changed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Those early days are indeed a distant memory for the
distinguished Fed chief. Greenspan takes special pride in knowing
that his contributions are recognized. Most gratifying, he
believes, is his ranking on People magazine's list of the
millennium's Most Intriguing People, just behind Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton noted last week that the Fed chairman had
guided the world to prosperity through his own ``sophisticated
analysis'' of economic trends.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is indeed a serious student of economics. Whenever
confronted with a particularly knotty question, he uses a technique
he developed over many years, first during his days at Columbia
University and later at the Kentucky Horseshoeing School. This
involves seating himself in a comfortable armchair, tilting his
head back, closing his eyes, and placing a nickel on each eyelid.
In this state, he ponders monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes, he moves into the conclusive phase of his
deliberation, that is, he flips one of the nickels. The right
answer _ Raise rates? Lower rates? _ rests on the luck of the toss.
It hasn't failed him yet.
