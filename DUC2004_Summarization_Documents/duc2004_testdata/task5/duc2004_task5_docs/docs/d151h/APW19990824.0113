<HEADLINE> Greenspan Gets Nod From Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some criticize him and one wants to sit him  
down for a ``heart-to-heart talk'' about economics. But few in the 
field of presidential candidates say Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan is the wrong man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who announced a quarter-point interest rate hike  
Tuesday, ends his current four-year term on June 30, 2000. Wall 
Street expects President Clinton to ask him to stay on for another 
four-year term at that point, taking pressure off his successor to 
make that choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked theoretically if they would appoint Greenspan  
themselves, only former vice president Dan Quayle was firm that he 
would not. Patrick Buchanan's campaign officials did not return 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Elizabeth Dole approves of Greenspan's performance  
and would reappoint him if she were elected, said her spokesman Ari 
Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole believes ``Greenspan has been a steady hand, has steadied  
the economy, and represents a stabilizing figure for our workers 
and our markets,'' said Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, in an interview last month, would not  
say definitively whether he would reappoint Greenspan, but did 
praise his performance as Fed chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll send you the clearest message that I think is appropriate  
to send,'' Gore said. ``I personally think no one could have 
possibly done a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's record, Gore said, is ``one of really outstanding  
A-plus-plus performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
said earlier this month that he would approve of Clinton 
reappointing Greenspan for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the most important thing that you can have in a  
Fed chairman is somebody who has the confidence of the financial 
markets. Alan Greenspan has that,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, would  
also reappoint Greenspan, said spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Steve Forbes, who has been highly critical of the Federal  
Reserve's interest rate increases, would not rule Greenspan out, 
said spokeswoman Juleanna Glover. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would consider reappointing Mr. Greenspan only after having  
a heart-to-heart talk to ensure that Mr. Greenspan understood that 
prosperity does not cause inflation,'' said Glover. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate Gary Bauer praised Greenspan overall but said he would  
wait to decide about reappointing him until he could judge his 
performance over the next 12 months. Like Forbes, Bauer has 
strongly criticized the Fed's recent interest rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain approves of Greenspan, but thinks it is  
premature to consider his reappointment now, said spokesman Howard 
Opinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was the only presidential hopeful who said he would  
definitely not consider reappointing Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' said spokesman Jonathan Baron. He said Quayle disagrees  
with the Fed's policy on raising interest rates. ``To raise the 
interest rates at this time as part of an effort to fight a 
nonexistent inflation makes no sense,'' said Baron.
