<HEADLINE> Gore Praises Alan Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While President Clinton has not yet tipped his  
hand about reappointing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
Vice President Al Gore has sent a strong signal that he would favor 
such an action, calling Greenspan's performance ``A-plus-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's current four-year term as head of the central bank  
ends on June 20, 2000, and there has been widespread speculation 
that President Clinton will end up asking him to stay on for a 
fourth term rather than try to win confirmation of someone else by 
the Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about that possibility Thursday, Gore said that he and  
Clinton had a policy of avoiding public discussions of personnel 
matters until it was time to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Democratic presidential hopeful added, ``I'll send you  
the clearest signal I think is appropriate to send. ... I 
personally believe that no one could have possibly done a better 
job. I think he has done an outstanding job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Greenspan's ``overall record is one of really an  
outstanding A-plus-plus performance. And so you can interpret that 
I hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That strong endorsement of Greenspan, a Republican, from the  
Democratic front-runner follows similar comments from the camp of 
the GOP presidential front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Lindsey, an economic adviser to Bush who served as a  
Fed board member with Greenspan, has said that Clinton should not 
wait until Greenspan's term is over but rather announce immediately 
his decision to reappointment him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan has come to be seen as the economy's indispensable  
man and the prospect that he might depart when his term expires 
next June is creating uncertainty about the future course of 
monetary policy,'' Lindsey wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall 
Street Journal on July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, this is a potent recipe for economic trouble --  
the most effective remedy for which is for President Clinton to 
reappoint Mr. Greenspan at once for another term,'' Lindsey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said this month that he has yet to have a discussion  
with Greenspan about the Fed job, but there is a widespread view in 
Congress that Greenspan is likely to be asked to stay on by Clinton 
because of Clinton's approval of Greenspan's handling of the 
economy and the difficulty of gaining approval for anyone else in 
Clinton's last year in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, 73, a prominent Republican economist, was first  
appointed Fed chairman in 1987 by Ronald Reagan. He is serving his 
third four-year term, having been reappointed by Presidents Bush 
and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Greenspan is not universal among presidential  
candidates currently in the field. Republican presidential 
candidate Steve Forbes criticized Greenspan last month after the 
Fed nudged up a key interest rate by a quarter-point. Forbes 
complained that Fed policies over the past 18 months have been too 
restrictive and have contributed to the steep plunge in farm 
commodity prices.
