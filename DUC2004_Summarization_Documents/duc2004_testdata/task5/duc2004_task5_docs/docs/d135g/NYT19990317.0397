   Having floated some 20,000 miles over Europe, Africa, Asia, the
Pacific Ocean and Central America, the Breitling Orbiter 3 headed
into the home stretch over the Atlantic Ocean Wednesday in its bid
to become the first balloon to circle the world nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and
Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more
promising with each passing hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that the huge
Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of the Earth on
Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As the Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft, however,
the two pilots were complaining of exhaustion and said they were
worried that the propane used in the balloon's burners might run
out before the craft reached the finish line: 9.27 degrees west
longitude.
</P>
<P>
   But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds
correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have
enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before
fuel runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The balloonists will try to avoid landing in Algeria or Libya,
where they are uncertain of the political climate. A ditching at
sea has not been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   When the balloon took off from Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, it
initially flew southwestward, reaching 9.27 degrees west longitude
before catching a favorable jet stream and heading eastward around
the world. Thus, 9.27 degrees west longitude represents the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   If the Breitling team makes it, they will enter the record books
as winners of the last great goal of ballooning. Many have tried
before them but all have fallen far short, including the roughly 20
attempts made during the last decade alone. Only last week a
British balloon, the Cable &AMP; Wireless, was forced to end a
round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his co-pilot, Brian Jones, a
52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and
cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the company offered the prize and a trophy, the
Budweiser Cup, to the first balloonist to circle the world nonstop.
Gregory Hendricks, a Budweiser spokesman, said Wednesday the
challenge remained in effect, and, he added: ``We're wishing good
luck to the Breitling crew.''

   The Breitling balloon faced staggering problems to get this far.
Besides the vagaries of wind direction and speed, there were storms
to avoid and regions of dead air where the balloon might have
become stuck until fuel ran out.
</P>
<P>
   There were many technical problems, including the accumulation
of ice on the propane burners. Worst of all, some of the nations
along the round-the-world track did not open their airspace to
balloons and had to be avoided. China gave last-minute permission,
but only on condition that the balloon remain south of the 26th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in
stretches where the crew could exploit jet streams, the Breitling
sped at more than 100 miles an hour. On two occasions, prompted
partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape
the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists
ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the
frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Piccard reported that he and Jones had been having
trouble sleeping. In his psychiatric work Piccard frequently uses
hypnosis and is adept at hypnotizing himself to fall asleep. But
the technique apparently failed during the last few exhausting
days. &QL;
