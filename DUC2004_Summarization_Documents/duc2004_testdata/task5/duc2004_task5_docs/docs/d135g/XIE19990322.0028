<HEADLINE> Record-Setting Balloonists Picked up in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military helicopter
picked up the two balloonists who succeeded in circumnavigating
the earth in a hot-air balloon before landing in southern Egypt on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the helicopter, one of the three heading for the
landing site in the Dakhla Oasis, 485 kilometers southwest of
Cairo, spotted Bertrand Piccard and his fellow aviator Brian Jones
several hours after their landing, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter carried the two balloonists to Dakhla airport,
where Piccard and Jones will be flown to Cairo to hold a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
After nearly 20 days of circumnavigating the globe, the
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon, in which the two balloonists were in,
landed gently at 08:03 local time (0603 GMT) at Mut, a town in the
Dakhla Oasis.
</P>
<P>
The successful landing of the balloon has ensured Piccard and
Jones a place in history as the first aviators to fly non-stop
around the world in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, a
51-year-old British instructor and grandfather, had wanted to land
near the pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo, but unfavorable winds
kept them away.
</P>
<P>
After 19 days aloft, the huge silver balloon, 54 meters tall,
or as high as 13 stories, floated over Mauritania past longitude 9
degrees west at 0954 GMT Saturday to complete the 41,841-kilometer
non-stop circumnavigation.
