	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The balloon that made aviation history by  
traveling nonstop around the globe was nearly lost to the wind when 
it landed in Egypt after its 20-day ride in the jet streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloonists Brian Jones and Bertrand Piccard tore their billowy  
craft to keep it from dragging the gondola across the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bertrand and I were furiously trying to slash it with our  
knives, just to get the extra helium out,'' Jones said Wednesday 
after a ceremony to donate the torn and tattered balloon to the 
Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. ``We could 
have detached it and let it blow away in the wind, but we knew it 
was a piece of history and we really didn't want it to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in September, it will be on display at the museum  
alongside Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis airplane, Orville 
and Wilbur Wright's 1903 flyer and the Apollo 11 command module 
from man's first mission to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon, known as the Breitling Orbiter 3, will arrive at  
the museum after exhibits in Switzerland and London. The museum's 
``Milestones of Flight'' gallery is spacious, but it's not big 
enough to house the inflated balloon, which soars to 181 feet -- 
about as tall as the Tower of Pisa in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieces of the balloon, made of a thin, reflective synthetic  
material, will be displayed, but the main attraction will be the 
craft's high-tech gondola. About the size of two minivans, the 
gondola has a bunk, toilet, kitchen area, control panel, oxygen and 
nitrogen tanks, solar panels, satellite phones and a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarters were tight, but the two balloonists say they did not  
exchange a cross word during their more than 26,500-mile journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have to overcome nature ... we had to harmonize with  
the wind,'' said Jones, a 52-year-old British pilot and balloon 
instructor. ``We just had to put our capsule into a position where 
Mother Nature could just take us in her arms. It was a wonderful 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their effort, Anheuser-Busch Cos. made good on its 1997  
pledge to give $1 million to the first balloon team to travel 
nonstop around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will share half the money. The rest will be used to  
support humanitarian projects around the world, said Marie Bodman, 
president of Breitling U.S.A. Inc., part of a Swiss company that 
makes watches and precision instruments and sponsored the balloon 
excursion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1984, eight ballooning teams, including five from America,  
have attempted the feat, said museum director Donald Engen. Jones 
and Piccard, 41, a Swiss doctor who specializes in psychiatry, were 
the first to succeed -- in 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	They launched the balloon on March 1 in the Swiss Alps. When it  
landed March 21 in the desert, Piccard opened the gondola hatch, 
put his feet in the sand and thought about Neil Armstrong, the 
first man to walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was so happy to be so far away, Piccard said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were so happy to put our footprint back on the Earth,'' he  
said.
