   LONDON _ Brian Jones, the co-pilot on the Breitling mission,
would have remained a quiet but crucial part of his team's
ballooning effort if it had not been for a series of lucky breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is to turn 52 next week, is actually the team's third
co-pilot. The first, Wim Verstraeten of Belgium, the longtime
flying partner of Bertrand Piccard, the pilot, pulled out of the
effort after a failed mission by Breitling 2 a year ago. Then the
second, Anthony Brown of Britain, quit last November over
differences in style and personality with Piccard. That left the
back-up man, Jones, Breitling's project manager, who had taken the
necessary flight training and was poised to step into place.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Britain's high-profile balloonist, Richard Branson, the
billionaire businessman whose own around-the-world effort most
recently was thwarted when he had to land in the sea last
Christmas, Jones is unknown here except in ballooning circles. He
is no swashbuckler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Jones seems the most unlikely person to become the most
famous balloonist in England,'' John Christopher, the editor of
Aerostat, a magazine for professional balloonists, told the Press
Association here. ``He is an ordinary, very likable guy who is not
a great egotist or publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very easygoing, with no spectacular achievements in his
past,'' Christopher added, calling Jones ``a very experienced and
all-around balloonist who has suddenly found himself in this
extraordinary position.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Bristol in 1947, Jones learned to fly at 16, dropping
out of school a year later to join the Royal Air Force. After 13
years of service, he joined a catering business and, in the 1980s,
set about becoming a professional balloonist.
</P>
<P>
   After earning his commercial balloon flying license, Jones
became a ballooning instructor in 1989 and was certified as an
examiner for balloon flight licenses by the British Civil Aviation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   He helped organize Breitling's most recent around-the-world
attempts, in 1997 and 1998. Until he moved from his position as
back-up pilot to pilot, he was an on-the-ground man, responsible as
the team's project manager for the construction of both the
balloon's gondola and its flight systems.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of nearly nine years, Joanna, 45, is also a balloonist
and has been in Breitling's flight control center at Geneva Airport
since the balloon was launched on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who lives in the town of Erlestoke, Wiltshire, has two
children and three grandchildren.
