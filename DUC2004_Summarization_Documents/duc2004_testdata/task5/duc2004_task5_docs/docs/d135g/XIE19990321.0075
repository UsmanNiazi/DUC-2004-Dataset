<HEADLINE> Globe-Circling Balloon Lands in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss
Bertrand Piccard and British Brian Jones completed their nonstop
circumnavigation on a hot-air balloon and landed in southern Egypt
smoothly Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon landed gently at 08:03 local
time (0603 GMT) at Mut, a town in the Kakhla Oasis 485 kilometers
southwest of Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 54-meter-high silver balloon floated over Mauritania
Saturday past longitude 9 degrees west to complete the
41,841-kilometer-plus circumnavigation and set a record for
an around-the-world voyage without a stop.
</P>
<P>
Piccard, a 41-year-old psychiatrist, and Jones, a 51-year-old
instructor and grandfather, had intended to land near the pyramids
on the outskirts of Cairo, but unfavorable winds kept them
southwest of their goal.
