	GENEVA (AP) -- One of two exhausted balloonists trying to become  
the first to circle the globe nonstop sobbed with joy and relief 
Friday when he was told they have enough fuel to reach the finish 
line in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and  
British adventurer Brian Jones will conquer one of the last great 
challenges in aviation on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, their 180-foot-high Breitling Orbiter 3 was more than  
halfway across the Atlantic, being swept along by a jet stream at 
up to 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Their control center in Geneva said they had gained about six  
hours and were on course to cross longitude 9 degrees west at about 
midday Saturday (7 a.m. EST). That's the same line where they began 
their trip nearly three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the balloonists are expected to be above  
Mauritania, on Africa's northwest coast. They plan to push on, over 
Algeria and Libya to Egypt, where they believe it will be easier to 
land and where Jones has long dreamed of ending the odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
	But if they're too tired, they will drift down in Mali, flight  
director Alan Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to put down in some part of the desert surrounded  
by lions, jackals and other dangerous animals, then we will do 
it,'' Noble said. ``But what we would dearly like to do is to get 
them down in Egypt near the pyramids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard broke into tears when controllers told him there should  
be enough fuel and that weather conditions were right for a landing 
in Egypt -- a total journey of 29,206 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a satellite telephone linkup, Piccard said he was using  
self-hypnosis to calm himself and cope with tension that has 
accumulated during the 19-day odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of stress,'' said Piccard, 41, who comes from a  
family of pioneers and is making his third round-the-world bid. 
``It's really not a picnic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is right down to the wire,'' said Jones, a 51-year-old  
balloon instructor. ``Of course we're hopeful and we're secretly 
confident, but we can't sit back in our chairs and make the winds 
take us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of frustrating delays, Piccard and Jones set off  
from the Swiss Alps on March 1. They drifted down to North Africa 
and then crossed toward Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike rival balloonists, the Breitling Orbiter crew had an  
advantage in that they got permission to pass over southern China, 
a move that saved them vital time. They then picked up a fast jet 
stream over the Pacific before grinding to a near halt over Central 
America. There the pilots developed breathing problems and got the 
shivers as their small cabin chilled to 46 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very stressed and very cold,'' Piccard recounted.  
``But now it's all going well again and we've put it behind us as a 
bad dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon finally picked up a jet stream again Thursday. Early  
Friday, they beat the endurance record set two weeks ago by two 
British balloonists who later ditched in bad weather near Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Once at its destination, the balloon probably will hover and  
make its final descent at dawn Sunday but a night landing was not 
out of the question, Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have night vision goggles onboard, which are fairly  
powerful. But the desert is not all sand dunes. There are quite a 
few mansions there, which would be uncomfortable.''
