<HEADLINE> Balloon Team Crosses Mexico </HEADLINE>

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Swiss-English balloon team soared over  
Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the 
Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to 
travel nonstop around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, that little puddle is what they call the Pacific,'' Brian  
Jones of England deadpanned in a message sent to the team's support 
crew in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The support crew in Geneva popped open a bottle of champagne as  
the balloon approached the Mexican coast. ``We're pleased that the 
Pacific is now behind them,'' flight controller Brian Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, who lifted off from  
the Swiss Alps on March 1, were over Belize in Central America this 
morning. They were heading into the Caribbean toward Jamaica, the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti, the control center said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will try to pick up a stream over the eastern Caribbean  
by Friday and then head for North Africa. At the moment, it is 
expected to cross the ``finish'' line in Mauritania -- somewhere 
along longitude 9 degrees west -- Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more  
than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have 
conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get there, I really won't be able to believe it,''  
Piccard told Swiss Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anheuser-Busch company is offering a $1 million prize --  
$500,000 to the first person or team to make it, and $500,000 to 
the charity of the winner's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard  
Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were forced to ditch their 
balloon off Hawaii on Dec. 25 after flying around more than half 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S.-Australian team canceled its planned attempt in  
mid-January. On March 7, two British balloonists abandoned their 
attempt because of bad weather, landing in the Pacific near Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Piccard and Jones set a record on Tuesday, breaking  
the old mark for longest distance flown in a balloon: 14,236 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific crossing was sluggish at first, with the Breitling  
Orbiter balloon slowing at times to 30 mph. But the team managed to 
catch a ride on the jetstream southeast of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloonists cruised over Mexico at 53 mph at an altitude of  
36,000 feet, their control center reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said the speed helped conserve propane, which fuels  
the burners in the lower, hot-air section of the balloon. The 
burners are needed to keep the balloon afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said it still is unable to predict where the balloon  
will land if it reaches North Africa, but that it probably won't 
make it as far as the pyramids, where Jones had hoped to come down 
</P>
<P>
	It said predictions of the landing spot will probably begin  
Thursday and will get progressively more accurate.
