THE WEAK CASE AGAINST WEN HO LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, the scientist who has been painted as a spy who
betrayed his country to the Chinese Communists, has raised
questions about that accusation that deserve answers. In a ``60
Minutes'' broadcast Sunday night, Lee, a US citizen born in Taiwan,
cast doubt on the conclusions of a report by the House Select
Committee chaired by Republican Christopher Cox of California.
</P>
<P>
   To date there is no evidence that Lee committed espionage. He
did violate security regulations at the Los Alamos laboratory, and
his appearance on ``60 Minutes'' allowed him to make the case that
as the only Asian-American working in the X Division, or weapons
sector, at Los Alamos, he has been singled out and scapegoated.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for national security, for federal laboratories
such as Los Alamos, and for public perceptions that some clarity be
brought to the spy scare.
</P>
<P>
   Lee does not deny that he downloaded classified nuclear codes
from a secure computer in the lab to an unsecured computer in the
lab. He maintains that he took precautions to make access to the
downloaded material virtually impossible for anyone but himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was foolish to be so cavalier with classified material, and
the authorities at Los Alamos had a right to fire him for his
foolishness. But if it is true, as he charges, that many other
weapons scientists did the same thing, then they, too, should be
fired, or Lee should be reinstated. There should be no favoritism
and no scapegoating in the lab's enforcement of security
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, managers at Los Alamos, officials in the
executive branch, and members of Congress owe it to Lee and the
American public to clear up the accumulating mystifications about
the espionage allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board chaired by former
Republican senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire summarized the
exaggerations of the Cox report by saying: ``Possible damage has
been minted as probable disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, inference and hypothesizing are the only grounds for
believing that Beijing obtained US nuclear secrets by means of
espionage. A RAND Corporation military analyst who testified before
the Cox committee, James Mulvernon, has said: ``The US is no more
at threat now than before this alleged espionage. It is only half
the battle to steal technology. China has not fielded any weapon _
and does not appear to be planning to _ that has any technology
said to be stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   The original reason for believing that China had benefited from
nuclear espionage was a stack of papers given to US officials in an
Asian embassy by someone who walked in off the street _ and whom US
intelligence later identified as a double agent sent by Chinese
intelligence. Everything in the planted documents was available
from unclassified sources except for drawings of an advanced,
miniaturized US nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Working by pure deduction, some counterintelligence officials
came to the conclusion that since Wen Ho Lee worked on the W-88 and
had contacts with Chinese scientists, he would be the likeliest
suspect for a posited case of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the US intelligence community has come up with no
satisfactory explanation of why Beijing might have wanted to inform
American authorities that China possessed drawings of the W-88. One
possibility is that the Chinese wanted to alert US intelligence to
lax nuclear weapons security so Washington would clamp down and
prevent third countries such as India from acquiring advanced
missile designs. The double agent could also have been used to send
a message of deterrence: that if provoked, China could spend the
lavish sums required to develop and deploy its own multiple-warhead
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Also unknown is the means by which Beijing obtained the W-88
drawings. They were not necessarily handed to Chinese agents by Wen
Ho Lee or any other scientist at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Scapegoating Wen Ho Lee without evidence of espionage and
deterring foreigners and foreign-born citizens from working at Los
Alamos or other federal labs can only harm American science and
traduce the American tradition of fairness.
