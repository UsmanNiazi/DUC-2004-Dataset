<HEADLINE> Lee's Wife, CIA Reportedly Tied  </HEADLINE>

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's wife worked for the CIA, a
revelation that could undermine the government's case against the
scientist accused of breaching security at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the San Jose Mercury News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed congressional, intelligence and other sources,
the newspaper said Sylvia Lee supplied information about Chinese
scientists to a CIA officer when she was a secretary at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in the 1980s. She worked as liaison between the
lab and visiting delegations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the newspaper said, Wen Ho Lee, who worked at the lab for
nearly 20 years, and his wife met with a CIA official before they
went to China in 1986, a trip federal prosecutors have called
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow told The Associated Press he had not
seen the article.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't discuss specifics of it because it is a matter
currently before the courts,'' Harlow said, ''but I can assure you
she didn't work for the CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee's lawyer Mark Holscher has portrayed Lee and his wife
as loyal Americans who did undercover work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Holscher's office was not immediately returned Sunday.
Wen Ho Lee attorney John Cline declined to comment, and another Wen
Ho Lee attorney, Brian Sun, declined comment until he could talk to
his clients. The U.S. Attorney's office also could not be reached
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is jailed in New Mexico awaiting a November trial on charges
that he mishandled classified data. Although he has been
investigated for spying, he has not been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   For a conviction, prosecutors must convince a jury that Lee took
data with the intent to harm the United States or aid another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lee has not been charged.
