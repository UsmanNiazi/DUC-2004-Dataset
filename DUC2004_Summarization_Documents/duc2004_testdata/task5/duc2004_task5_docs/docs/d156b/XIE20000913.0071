<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Wen Ho Lee Set Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Los Alamos nuclear
scientist Wen Ho Lee was set free and reunited with his family
Wednesday after pleading guilty to one charge under a plea
agreement in which prosecutors all but abandoned their crumbling
case against him.
</P>
<P>
Bound by the plea agreement, U.S. District Judge James Parker
sentenced the fired Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist to
278 days, essentially the time served since his arrest last
December.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner
in which you were held in custody by the executive branch," the
judge told the scientist at a hearing in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Lee was set free and reunited with his family shortly after his
sentencing.
