<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Appeals Bail Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A fired weapons lab scientist is appealing a lower court
ruling denying him bail as he awaits trial for allegedly mishandling some of the
nation's top nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Wen Ho Lee filed their notice of appeal Tuesday in the 10th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, has pleaded innocent to 59 counts under the Atomic Energy and
Espionage Acts. If convicted, the former employee of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory could be sentenced to life in prison. A trial may be a year away.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., U.S. District Judge James Parker rejected Lee's
request for bail on Dec. 29, referring to missing computer tapes containing
classified material and citing the potential for ``enormous harm'' to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding an earlier ruling, Parker said he would likely reconsider Lee's
request depending on the results of another lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   The charges allege Lee transferred classified material from secure to
unsecure computers and to computer tapes. Seven of the tapes remain missing. The
indictment does not accuse Lee of passing classified information to a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has said he destroyed the tapes after losing his security clearance. He
was fired in March, a month after he failed questions on a polygraph test that
lab officials said asked whether he had passed information and classified codes
to a foreign country.
