<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Orders Review of Wen Ho Lee Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno told President Bill Clinton on Friday that the Justice
Department will review the case of former Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute meeting at the White House, Reno told Clinton
that "she has asked the Office of Professional Responsibility to
do a thorough review, as is their practice when ... questions have
been raised by a prosecution, like this one by a judge or others,"
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that both Clinton and Reno agreed that "the most
important thing we can do is to try to get to the bottom of this (
case)."
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Reno and Clinton was arranged after the
president said last week that he had been "quite troubled" by the
treatment of Lee, who was held in solitary confinement for nine
months without bail before his release under a plea agreement with
the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the release of Lee last week, Federal Judge James
Parker apologized to the Taiwan-born scientist and said that the
way the departments of Justice and Energy handled this case "had
embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of
it."
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the 60-year-old Lee had been singled
out for prosecution simply because he is ethnic Chinese.
