Commenting on the indictment of Lee on December 10 by relevant
U.S. departments, spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said that there are

cold war' mentality, and purposefully concocted the so-called lie
alleging China's theft of U.S. nuclear technologies.

"They attempt to defame China and impair Sino-U.S. relations,"
she said, adding that "it has been proved with facts that their
conspiracy will not work."
