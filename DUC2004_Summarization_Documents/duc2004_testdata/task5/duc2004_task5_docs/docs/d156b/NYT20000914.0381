   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Is this America? To think of Wen Ho Lee in
his nine months of solitary confinement is to think not of Horatio
Alger, but of Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   Has the American dream turned into the American nightmare? We
are treated today to the pictures of Wen Ho Lee free to go fishing
but are haunted by our private visions of him shackled and alone.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it can be proved he was a victim of racial
profiling, Lee's case dramatizes what many Americans believe to be
true: There is opportunity here, but justice? Equality before the
law? No, not for the model minority, it appears.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot know if Wen Ho Lee was singled out because of his
race. But the experience of many Asian-Americans, myself included,
is such that we would be more surprised to discover that he had not
than to learn that he had.
</P>
<P>
   We know too well the associative nature of the mainstream
imagination, which manages to link Asian-Americans of any type to
whatever Asian phenomenon might be momentarily tweaking its poor
gray noodle.
</P>
<P>
   This is sometimes funny. I once shared a stage with a former
senator who was so moved by his own account of the bravery of
Japanese-American soldiers in World War II that he turned from his
lectern and looked, dramatically, repeatedly, straight at me every
time he said ``Japanese.'' And what a moment for history it would
have been if only I had been Japanese or Japanese-American.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples are less funny: In 1982, Vincent Chin, a
Chinese-American, was murdered in Detroit by unemployed autoworkers
incensed by Japanese competition. Wen Ho Lee was assumed
sympathetic to the People's Republic of China even though he was
born and brought up in Taiwan, an island not known for its
adoration of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   We are sick of being seen as not quite American, of being
viewed, generation after generation, as guests to be welcomed _ or
not.
</P>
<P>
   The association of a Taiwan-born American citizen with mainland
espionage efforts might seem to be what Jody Armour would call
``reasonable racism'' _ but it is not reasonable, and causes real
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Wen Ho Lee case began, the number of Asian and
Asian-American scientists applying to work in our nation's weapons
labs has declined dramatically. Many would-be applicants have
expressed fears of harassment and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is now investigating
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in response to claims of
discrimination by nine employees; the agency is also investigating
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can see this is unfortunate for United States defense
research. But less appreciated is the bitterness in the hearts of
the scientists involved, or of the many others seeking work
elsewhere. These were, by and large, people who believed in America
_ people who hoped to believe in it, and who deserved to believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Today Wen Ho Lee is free, and Asian-American advocacy groups are
flexing new muscle. In apologizing to Wen Ho Lee, Judge James
Parker displayed a courageous, refreshing, most American candor
that would be unthinkable in other parts of the world. The system
ultimately worked.
</P>
<P>
   Still this case gives us reason to raise the hue and cry. A
thorough investigation is certainly in order. Maybe the question
is: Who could most objectively mount such an investigation?
</P>
<P>
   As a friend suggested to me, perhaps in cases like this the
Justice Department should set up a citizen review board similar to
those that oversee police departments in some cities. This would be
a good first step toward restoring public confidence in our
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   But how to restore faith in the American dream? That will take
investigations of a wider, deeper sort.
