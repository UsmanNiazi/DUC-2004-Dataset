<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Challenges 'Secret' Label  </HEADLINE>

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for a scientist accused of putting
nuclear secrets on unsecured computer tapes said the information, far from being
``crown jewels'' of U.S. weapons science, was not even classified top secret.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee's attorneys, in a filing sent Thursday to the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Denver, said if the information had been as vital as
government witnesses said it was, it would have been given the top secret
classification.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the tapes contained information that was classified secret or
confidential restricted data, they said in seeking to get Lee released from jail
pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office had no comment on the filing, said spokeswoman
Patricia Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, fired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in March, is accused of
transferring nuclear weapons information to unsecured computers and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, has pleaded innocent to 59 criminal counts under the Atomic Energy
and Espionage acts. He is not charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. weapons labs executives testified at Lee's detention hearings that the
tapes contain electronic blueprints to a variety of weapons designs -- from
easily made atomic bombs attractive to terrorists to thermonuclear warheads the
officials said they feared could change the global nuclear balance of power.
