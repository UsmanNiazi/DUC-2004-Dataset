<HEADLINE> Germany Shelves Extradition of Kurdish Leader Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany has declined to seek the
extradition of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan from Italy at the
present time, government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, 49, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has
been in detention in Rome since last Thursday. He has applied for
political asylum in Italy.
</P>
<P>
He has also been wanted by German prosecutors for charges
including murder since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Heye said the German government would not cancel the arrest
warrant for Ocalan as the efforts for Ocalan's extradition were
only being deferred.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government is seeking the extradition of Ocalan to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"In view of these facts and developments the government is
deferring a German extradition bid," Heye said.
