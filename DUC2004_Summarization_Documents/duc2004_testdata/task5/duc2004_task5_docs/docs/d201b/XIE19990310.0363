<HEADLINE> Ocalan's Brother Vows to Continue War for Kurdish State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) - Osman Ocalan, the brother of captured
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, intends to continue the armed
struggle in Turkey, he said to German Press.
</P>
<P>
"We are now forced to rely on a violent solution," Osman Ocalan
told the magazine, which is due on the newsstands on Thursday,
according to a report of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was
seized in Kenya on February 16 and flown to Turkey in an undercover
operation that sparked a wave of protests by Kurds across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ocalan said that a political dialogue would only be
considered if Ankara released Abdullah Ocalan and recognised him as
the representative of the Kurdish people.
</P>
<P>
"Popular revolts" would take place in Turkish cities and suicide
attacks would be launched against military targets, Osman Ocalan said.
The 43-year-old is in hiding in the mountains of northern Iraq near
the border with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the PKK would not wage war again in European
capitals and neither would it kill tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Marxist-Leninist PKK has for 14 years been fighting a war
against the Turkish government in an effort to set up a Kurdish state
of Kurdistan. Between 35,000 and 40,000 people have died in the
hostilities.
