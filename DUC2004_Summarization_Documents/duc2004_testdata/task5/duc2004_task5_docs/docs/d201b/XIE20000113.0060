<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes Turkey's Decision to Delay Ocalan's Hanging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday welcomed the
decision by Turkey to postpone the hanging of the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas described the
Turkish move as a "correct decision," saying that Greece had
opposed the PKK leader's execution from the time of his trial.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was blamed by Turkey for leading a 15-year Kurdish
rebellion, was arrested last February and sentenced to death last
June.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government Wednesday decided to postpone the
execution of a death sentence against Ocalan and to wait for a
European Court of Human Rights to review Ocalan's appeal.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that hanging Ocalan
without waiting for the European court's decision would seriously
harm the prospects of Turkey's joining the European Union (EU),
which has warned that hanging Ocalan would be a grave mistake.
