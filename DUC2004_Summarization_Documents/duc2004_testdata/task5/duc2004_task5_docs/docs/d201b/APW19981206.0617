Former Italian premier opposes asylum for Ocalan

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi, the former
conservative Italian premier, declared his opposition to possible
Italian political asylum to rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan,
the Anatolia news agency has reported.
	   In a letter sent to Serdar Denktash, the deputy premier of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, Berlusconi said the Italian
government should give up ``protecting Ocalan,'' Anatolia said
Saturday.
	   ``The leftist government in power is putting the traditional
friendship and a history of cooperation between Turkey and Italy at
risk by protecting a terrorist and forgetting how Italy suffered
from terrorism in the past,'' Anatolia quoted from the letter.
	   Berlusconi's letter was a reply to one sent to him by Denktash,
in which the Turkish Cypriot expressed the breakaway state's full
support to Turkey's extradition request.
