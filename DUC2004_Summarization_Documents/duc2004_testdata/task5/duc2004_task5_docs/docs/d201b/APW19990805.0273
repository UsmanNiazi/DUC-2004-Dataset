<HEADLINE> Kurd Rebels Agree To Leave Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebels agreed today to heed the  
call of their imprisoned leader to lay down their arms and withdraw 
to bases outside Turkey, a dramatic step in their 15-year-old-war. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah Ocalan, sentenced to death in June, had urged his  
followers Tuesday to unilaterally pull out of southeast Turkey by 
Sept. 1 in an attempt to open the way for dialogue with the 
government over the Kurdish question. 
</P>
<P>
	The separatist rebel group said today, ``Our party openly  
declares its full compliance with comrade president Ocalan's call 
and it will carry out its activities on this basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move ``is the new phase that our national liberation has  
reached and is the only way to solve the Kurdish question,'' said 
the statement, carried by a pro-Kurdish news agency DEM, based in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rebels stressed that the Turkish government must now  
``adopt a solution-seeking approach in the face of these historic 
steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey refused any compromise with the rebels after Ocalan's  
appeal. President Suleyman Demirel said today, ``The state needs no 
help in finishing this struggle.'' His prime minister, Bulent 
Ecevit, said Tuesday there could be no ``bargaining'' with the 
Kurdish group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, has fought for  
autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeastern region in a 
conflict that has cost 37,000 lives -- mostly Kurds. Since his 
capture in February, Ocalan has promised to seek peace if his life 
is spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the chief prosecutor asked an appeals court  
to uphold the death sentence for treason against Ocalan, despite 
opposition to the execution from several European countries and 
rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite pressure by foreign officials ... the approval of the  
verdict about defendant Abdullah Ocalan is being requested,'' Vural 
Savas told the appeals court in an assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Savas said Ocalan violated treason laws hundreds of times ``by  
leading the ``most bloodiest terror organization of the 20th 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every death sentence in Turkey undergoes automatic appeal.  
Ocalan's is expected to be heard in early September. If upheld, the 
verdict would have to be endorsed by both parliament and Demirel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European countries and human rights groups have objected  
to Ocalan's execution. However, there is widespread public pressure 
in Turkey to hang Ocalan.
