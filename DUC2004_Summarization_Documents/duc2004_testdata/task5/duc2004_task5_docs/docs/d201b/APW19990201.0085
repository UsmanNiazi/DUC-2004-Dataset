<HEADLINE> Turkey to Greece: Don't Keep Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey warned Greece not to give refuge  
Monday to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who it claimed had 
landed at Athens airport after being rebuffed by the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Athens immediately denied the charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Early Monday, Ocalan was turned back by Dutch authorities as he  
headed to Rotterdam airport, where 200 Kurds were waiting to 
welcome him. There was no indication where he had come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on national radio, Dutch attorney Britta Bohler said  
Ocalan wanted to ask the International Court of Arbitration in The 
Hague to mediate between the Turkish government and Turkey's rebel 
Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Turkey's Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir  
told reporters that Ocalan was in a private plane in Athens, 
awaiting permission to disembark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's quest for a base to lead the Kurdistan Workers Party,  
or PKK, began last year, after Turkey successfully pressured Syria 
into ending years of refuge for him. Ocalan reported left Italy on 
Jan. 16 after two months of trying to win asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect Greece to be loyal to its assurances that it would  
not accept the terrorist leader,'' Haktanir said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Athens, Foreign ministry spokesman Theodoros Theodorou  
insisted no request has been made for Ocalan to come there. Asked 
whether Ocalan was in Greece, he replied ``No, of course not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's ambassador, Dimitrios Nezeritis, was summoned twice by  
Turkey's foreign ministry Monday and reiterated that Ocalan was not 
in Greece and that Athens would not let him in. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK has been at war with Turkey since 1984, in a conflict  
that has killed close to 37,000 people. Turkey has issued an 
international warrant against Ocalan on numerous charges, including 
leading a terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish Premier Bulent Ecevit warned nations not to accept  
Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcoming Ocalan means becoming an accomplice to his crimes,''  
Ecevit said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Italy, Ocalan's whereabouts were unknown although  
reports had placed him in locations ranging from Russia to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Ecevit claimed that Ocalan had returned to Rome;  
Italian authorities denied that.
