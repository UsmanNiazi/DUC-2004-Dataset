MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federal Security
Service avoided comment on Turkey's claim Monday that leader of
the Kurdish Workers Party Abdullah Ocalan had arrived at an
air-force base outside Moscow, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in Ankara that Ocalan
had left Italy for Russia.
</P>
<P>
"According to highly reliable sources, the separatist
organization's chief Abdullah Ocalan went to Russia and landed at
an airdrome outside Moscow," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a high-ranking
Kremlin official as saying that Ocalan was definitely not in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"No man with the name of Abdullah Ocalan is going anywhere in
Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has ordered a
verification of the reports, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"On orders from the chairman of the Russian government, the
corresponding services are checking whether the information about
Ocalan has any grounds," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Russian Aeroflot office in Rome also denied
allegations that Ocalan had left Italy on board its plane, Tass
reported.
