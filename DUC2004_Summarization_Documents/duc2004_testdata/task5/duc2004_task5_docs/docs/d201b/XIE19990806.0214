<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Pushes for Approval of Ocalan's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ignoring pressures from several
European countries and human rights groups, Vural Savas, the
chief prosecutor of Turkey's High Court of Appeals, asked the
court to uphold the death penalty for a Kurdish rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
Outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan,
captured by Turkish special anti-terror squads in Kenya in
mid-February and brought back to Turkey, was sentenced to death on
June 29 on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been waging a separatist campaign in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between the Turkish
security forces and the PKK rebels have claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Appeals was expected to review the Ocalan
file in early September after a judicial recess, the Daily News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
If upheld, the verdict would have to be endorsed by the
Parliament and President Suleyman Demirel before carried out.
</P>
<P>
"Despite pressure by foreign officials whose support to Ocalan
has been proved and the hostile attitude of so-called human rights
organizations against the Turkish Republic...the approval of the
verdict for defendant Abdullah Ocalan is being requested," Savas
said in his evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition to Ocalan's death sentence abroad,
there is wide-spread public pressure in Turkey to hang Ocalan. No
one has been executed in Turkey since 1984.
