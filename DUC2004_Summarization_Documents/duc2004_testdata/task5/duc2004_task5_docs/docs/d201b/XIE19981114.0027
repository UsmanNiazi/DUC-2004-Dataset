<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Extradition of PKK Leader From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Hasan
Denizkurdu Friday called for the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of a Kurdish terrorist group, from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Denizkurdu made the statement after Ocalan, head of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) was detained by Italian
police Thursday night upon his arrival in Rome by a passenger
plane of the Russian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The PKK leader was later taken to a military hospital for
health check.
</P>
<P>
Denizkurdu said that his ministry will give the file about
Ocalan to Italian Justice Ministry through Turkish Foreign
Ministry, adding that the Italian Justice Ministry will transfer
the issue to Italian court to give a decision about the
extradition.
</P>
<P>
"There is no legal obstacle for the extradition of Ocalan
from Italy," added the Turkish justice minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said here at
the same day that "Turkey has begun overall initiatives for
the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of separatist
terrorist PKK organization."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz also told reporters that
"I am pleased to share with you that as a result of our pressures
on Syria within the framework of our struggle against terrorism,
our struggle came to an extreme positive new stage: Abdullah
Ocalan who is responsible for the killings of thousands of people
for 14 years was captured in Italy."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was forced to leave Syria for Moscow as Turkey
threatened to launch military strikes against the PKK camps and
shelters on the Syrian territory if Damascus continues to
provide support for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
With Turkish pressure on the Russian government for the
extradition of Ocalan, Russia promised Turkey that Moscow will
not allow Ocalan to take shelter in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan leads the PKK separatist group which has been
fighting a 14-year-old war for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.
