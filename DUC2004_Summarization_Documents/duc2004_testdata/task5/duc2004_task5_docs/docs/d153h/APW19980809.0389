	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Sunday urged ordinary people to reclaim the United Nations as their
own _ a call he promptly reinforced by approaching some protesters
demonstrating against Indonesia's occupation of East Timor.
	   ``Mr. Annan, don't forget East Timor,'' shouted 23-year-old
Carlos Borneo as the secretary-general emerged from visiting the
United Nations pavilion at Lisbon's Expo '98 World Fair.
	   Annan approached Borneo's small group of protesters through a
sea of security guards.
	   ``I hear what you say. We are doing our best about East Timor''
he said, referring to recent U.N.-sponsored talks on the disputed
half-island territory before being whisked away for lunch with
Premier Antonio Guterres at the Portuguese pavilion.
	   Minutes before, Annan stressed at a joint press conference with
Guterres that persuading people to view the U.N. as ``their
organization'' was the key to revitalizing its work.
	   ``I know for a while we were too distant from the people. Too
bureaucratic,'' he said.
	   Annan arrived Friday in Portugal, where the focus of his
five-day visit is a U.N-sponsored international conference on youth
policy. He also is scheduled to meet with officials close to peace
efforts in Algeria, the former Portuguese colonies of Angola,
Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   Annan talked briefly on Sunday about what he called ``the
delicate situation'' in Angola.
	   He said preliminary reports from the recent 10-day visit of his
special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to the southwest African country
indicated ``the threat of an escalation of the violence has
receded.''
	   Brahimi's trip was prompted by the threat of a return to
full-scale conflict, four years after a U.N.-brokered accord sealed
a tenuous end to a 20-year civil war between UNITA rebels and
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government.
	   Annan called on Dos Santo and UNITA's emblematic leader Jonas
Savimbi to fulfill their promises to relaunch the peace process.
	   ``After so many decades of war, the people of Angola need and
deserve peace and their leaders have the responsibility to do all
they can,'' he said.
	   Annan also mentioned the U.N. investigative mission to Algeria
headed by former Portuguese President Mario Soares who looked into
the massacres and bombings that have killed an estimated 75,000
people since 1992. Soares returned to Lisbon last week to draw up a
report.
	   Annan said he had no yet seen the report, but stressed the group
was able to visit prisons and massacre sites and talk to a far
wider range of sources than previously possible.
	   Annan was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.
