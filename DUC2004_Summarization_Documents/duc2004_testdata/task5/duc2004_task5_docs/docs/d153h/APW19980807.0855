	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
optimistic Friday that his special envoy to Angola could rescue the
country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said referring to the
meetings held earlier this week by his special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi, leader the former rebel group UNITA.
	   Annan was speaking after arriving at Porto airport, 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Lisbon, to kick off a five-day
visit to Portugal, where he is to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   He is also to meet officials close to peace efforts in Algeria
and the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and
East Timor.
	   The United Nations sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an
emergency mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil
war, four years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the Security Council would be discussing Brahimi's
report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped the
council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring the
peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   Annan's arrival in Portugal had been postponed for 24 hours due
to Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting in New York to
discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons inspectors. Annan
did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan's first engagement in Portugal on Friday took him to the
closing ceremony of a U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in the
northern city of Braga. ``The voice of the young will be heard,''
he promised.
	   The Forum's recommendations to a ministerial conference on youth
policy beginning Saturday in Lisbon are expected to include
creation of a special rapporteur for youth at the U.N. and a
commitment from all states to elaborate a national youth strategy.
	   Annan's Saturday agenda included a meeting with former
Portuguese president Mario Soares to discuss the findings of the
recent high-level mission to Algeria investigating the roots of the
political violence rocking that country.
	   The mission has yet to release its findings.
	   Annan is also expected to meet President Jorge Sampaio, Premier
Antonio Guterres, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and, on Sunday, visit
to the Expo' 98 World Fair on United Nations Day.
	   He was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.
