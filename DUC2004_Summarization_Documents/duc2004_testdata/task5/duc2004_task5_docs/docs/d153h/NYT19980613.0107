ANNAN'S STRATOSPHERIC PROFILE GIVES U.N. A NEW FACE

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the first time in its half-century of life,
the United Nations seems to be basking in the glow of a celebrity
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, his aides say, is the man all New York wants at
dinner parties. In this season of graduation speeches,
photographers have zoomed in on him. He is held up as a fashion
example, and this month George magazine named him one of the 20
most fascinating men in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. family is not totally united in happiness about this.
When bulletin boards around headquarters became almost exclusively
devoted to photographs of his every meeting and trip _ Kofi
conquers Baghdad, Kofi goes Hollywood _ the grumbles started. Some
officials called the addition of a pictorial Annan display outside
the cafeteria a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Camera teams began to accompany the secretary general and his
wife, Nane, just about everywhere. Then came a little booklet of
speech extracts titled ``The Quotable Kofi Annan,'' published by
the organization's Department of Public Information. Was someone,
people asked, at work creating a cult of personality here? And if
so, who?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not accept the term `personality cult' because that's
not the way the U.N. functions,'' said Shashi Tharoor, a close aide
to Annan, as he acknowledged a role in these recent developments.
``Nothing could be more foreign to a man of Kofi Annan's extremely
well-known modesty and humility as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But'' Tharoor added, ``we have no apologies to make about
using Kofi Annan and his personal image to enhance the standing of
the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known writer on Indian politics and novelist, Tharoor has
years of experience in the United Nations. He is about to become
the secretary general's communications director, a new slot in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put a warm and human face on the U.N. is almost basic
public relations _ and Kofi Annan is that face,'' said Tharoor, who
worked with Annan in peacekeeping and moved with him to the
secretary general's office last year. ``In his first year and a
half in office, he has become increasingly identified to television
viewers around the world, and indeed to headline writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, Tharoor said, are the days when New York magazine could
joke, ``If you thought Kofi Annan was a decaffeinated brew ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration forced out Annan's predecessor,
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to get a leader it considered more
attractive to Congress. But it has seen many hopes dispelled by
Republican leaders' refusal to pay the organization a debt of over
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tharoor is optimistic, and banking on Annan's appeal.
Critics may describe the United Nations as a glass box full of
faceless bureaucrats, but Annan is a major exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have someone who is neither anonymous nor faceless and
comes across not as a bureaucrat but as a regular human being who
thinks, who is reflective, is witty and cares,'' Tharoor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the difficulties in our relationship,'' he said, ``given
the financial sword of Damocles over our heads, it would be crazy
not to use the secretary general's ability to reach out to
Americans.'' &QL;
