<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Recommends Kofi Annan for Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
has recommended to the General Assembly that Kofi Annan of Ghana
be appointed U.N. Secretary-General from 1 January 1997 to 31
December 2001.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Friday in a closed-door session after
France dropped its opposition to the 58-year-old African, who is
heading the U.N. peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council has taken an action of great historic
significance," said Chinese Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Qin Huasun to reporters. "By recommending Kofi Annan for
the 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations, the council
fulfilled its sacred responsibility under the U.N. Charter," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the process of the Secretary-General election,
Ambassador Qin said China has been firmly supporting the claim of
African countries that they have the right for a second term.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current world situation, a Secretary-General
selected from the African countries will not only help the
international community to have a better understanding of Africa,
but will also help Africa to contribute more to the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated both Kofi Annan and the African countries for
the desirable result, saying Annan is a remarkable representative
of the African continent, both energetic and experienced.
</P>
<P>
"Under his leadership," he said, "we believe the United Nations
can develop in a healthy and smooth way, thus making greater
efforts in safeguarding world peace and promoting world economic
and social development."
</P>
<P>
In a separate resolution, the council also acknowledged the
contribution of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to
international peace, security and development, his exceptional
efforts to solve international problems in economic, social and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
"During his five-year tenure," Ambassador Qin said,
"Boutros-Ghali has made strenuous efforts for and achieved great
results in adapting the United Nations to the changed post Cold
War situations and strengthening its role in the current world."
