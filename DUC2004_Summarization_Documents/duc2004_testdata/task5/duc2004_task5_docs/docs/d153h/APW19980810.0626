Annan says Angolan leaders must demonstrate commitment to peace

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
Monday that the United Nations could pull out of Angola if the
country's political leaders don't do their bit for peace.
	   ``When we determine that our presence is not making any
difference the Security Council may consider withdrawal, but I
don't think we are there yet,'' Annan in reference to Angola.
	   Annan called on political leaders in the vast Southwest African
nation to have the ``courage and determination'' to relaunch their
stymied peace process.
	   Thee U.N Secretary-General was speaking in Lisbon after meeting
with Foreign Minister Jaime Gama to discuss peace making efforts in
Angola, East Timor and Guinea-Bissau _ all former Portuguese
colonies.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi _
leader of the former rebel movement UNITA _ recently promised a
U.N. special envoy that they would stop delaying implementation of
a U.N.-brokered 1994 deal that established peace after two decades
of civil war.
	   The two leaders have made and broken similar promises before.
	   ``For the time being the U.N. is going to stay and work with the
leaders,'' Annan said without specifying how far U.N. patience
would stretch.
	   Personnel in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Angola currently
totals 728.
	   Annan also referred to the hopes raised by Indonesia's offer to
negotiate special autonomy status for the disputed territory of
East Timor in recent U.N.-brokered talks with Portugal.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.
	   ``It is important that Timorese representatives participate in
the negotiations, above all given the fact that (Indonesian
President Jusuf) Habibie has already promised to release political
prisoners and is withdrawing troops,'' Annan said.
	   Annan arrived in Portugal last Friday to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   On Tuesday, he is to meet with former Portuguese president Mario
Soares who heads the Independent World Oceans Commission on the
Oceans. The commission, launched in Japan in 1995, is due to
present a report to the U.N. this year.
	   The two diplomats are also expected to discuss Soares' recent
U.N. mission to Algeria to investigate the massacres and bombings
that have killed an estimated 75,000 people since 1992.
	   Annan is due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for vacation in his
native Ghana.
