<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General Visits His Home Country Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
arrived in Accra, Ghana's capital, on Saturday night kicking off a
five-day official visit, the first to his home country since his
election.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Nane, accompanied him. Already in the country are his
two children, Kojo and Ama, reported the Pan-African News Agency
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Jerry Rawlings and his wife, Nana Konadu Agyeman, met
Annan at the Kotoka International Airport in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Annan expressed his delight to be home
to meet fellow Ghanaians.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the main areas of the UN is the provision of an
early warning mechanism in conflict prevention, adding that the
organization prefers to prevent conflict instead of deploying
troops to such areas, a venture which is expensive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Security Council is considering a draft
proposal on the trial of Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United
Front and its leader, Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Annan would call on Rawlings, lay a wreath at
the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum, and receive a national honor, the
Order of the Star of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He would also receive an honorary Doctor of Law of the
University of Ghana, Legon, and cut the sod for the Kofi Annan
International Peacekeeping Training Center at the Ghana Armed
Forces Staff College.
