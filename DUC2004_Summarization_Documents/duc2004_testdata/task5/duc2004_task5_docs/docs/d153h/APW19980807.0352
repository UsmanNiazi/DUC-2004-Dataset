	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
optimistic on Friday that his special envoy to Angola could rescue
the country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said referring to the
meetings held earlier this week by his special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi _ leader the former rebel group UNITA.
	   Annan was speaking after arriving at Porto airport, 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Lisbon, to kick off a five-day
visit to Portugal.
	   During the trip, Annan is to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy. He is also to meet
officials close to peace efforts in Algeria and the former
Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   The U.N. sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an emergency
mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil war, four
years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the Security Council would be discussing Brahimi's
report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped the
council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring the
peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   The Secretary-General's arrival in Portugal had been postponed
for 24 hours due to Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting
in New York to discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons
inspectors. Annan did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan was due to attend the U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in
the northern city of Braga on Friday, before inaugurating a
ministerial conference on youth policy in Lisbon on Saturday.
	   His Friday agenda was also expected to include a meeting with
the high-level mission recently returned from a 10-day tour of
Algeria to investigate the roots of the political violence rocking
that country.
	   The mission, headed by former Portuguese president Mario Soares,
has yet to release its findings.
	   Annan's is also expected to meet President Jorge Sampaio,
Premier Antonio Guterres, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and, on
Sunday, visit to the Expo' 98 World Fair on United Nations Day.
	   He was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.
