<HEADLINE> Annan: No Opposition to Separate Probe Into His Role in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Wednesday that he would
not oppose any separate probe into his role in events surrounding
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Annan told Belgian radio that the Security Council has to be
involved in the inquiry. "It has to agree and we'll discuss all
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. head arrived here Tuesday night for a two-day visit
to Belgium. He met Belgian King Albert this morning, and is
expected to meet Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, NATO
officials and European Commission President Jacques Santer during
his stay.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival, relatives of Belgian and Rwandan victims of
the 1994 killings hold a protest, criticizing Annan's role in
U.N. mission's failure to prevent the massacre.
</P>
<P>
They also called for an independent investigation of U.N.
actions and Annan's role and urged him personally to set up a
separate panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
"Together we accused Kofi Annan of having a major
responsibility for the U.N. failure to prevent the 1994 genocide
in Rwanda," said Belgian senator Alain Destexhe, speaking on
behalf of the victims' relatives who also asked for a meeting
with the U.N. head. Annan said he agreed to meet them later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Annan was director of the U.N. peacekeeping
operations during the killings, in which about 800,000 people
were reportedly killed in Rwanda. Ten Belgian paratroopers in
the U.N. peacekeeping forces were also killed. Kofi Annan took
over office of the U.N. secretary general in January 1997.
