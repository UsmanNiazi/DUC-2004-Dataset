<HEADLINE> UN Assembly Appoints Kofi Annan Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly appointed on Tuesday Kofi Annan of Ghana
Secretary-General of the United Nations for a term of office
beginning on January 1, 1997 and ending on December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the resolution by acclamation, the General
Assembly elected a life-long international servant, who has been
working in the world organization for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In his long-time service in the world body, Kofi Annan worked
his way from ordinary administrative officer and budget officer of
the World Health Organization up to under-secretary-general of the
U.N. Secretariat in charge of the peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is consensus and commitment," said the
Secretary-General-Elect Kofi Annan in his inauguration speech.
"Our task is to find common ground, to shape together the changes
that will move this Organization forward."
</P>
<P>
Noting many roots of conflict, particularly the economic base
of stability, Annan stressed the need to help the developing
countries and the need of the developed countries to extend their
help.
</P>
<P>
"Let us ensure," said Annan, "that the resources and facilities
of the United Nations system are effectively channeled towards
those who need them most, those whom globalization has left
behind."
</P>
<P>
"And let us ensure that the voice of the United Nations in
economic matters is heard by those member states with the
greatest capacity to give," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the international community to support the
world organization, which mainly designed to use collective power
to prevent war.
</P>
<P>
"No nation need to face or fight alone the threats which this
organization was established to defuse," he said. "But we cannot
succeed without your political, moral, financial and material
support and participation."
</P>
<P>
"Applaud us when we prevail; correct us when we fail; but,
above all, do not let this indispensable, irreplaceable
institution wither, languish or perish as a result of Member State
indifference, inattention or financial starvation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly also adopted a resolution, expressing deep
appreciation of the 185-member states for the contributions of
Secretary-General Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace
and security and development.
</P>
<P>
"In saying farewell to this great Assembly," Dr. Boutros-Ghali
said, "I stressed nothing is more precious to the United Nations
than its reputation."
</P>
<P>
He said that reputation rests on four pillars: impartiality,
equity, efficiency and achievement and that the fifth,
indispensable principle is independence.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General's loyalty must be international and
nothing but international, and the international civil service
must be a real civil service," he said.
</P>
<P>
In apparent retort to American criticism about his performance,
he said: "Throughout the past five years, the first thing I
thought of when I awoke in the morning were my responsibilities as
Secretary General to the ideal of Charter and independence and
credibility of the Organization."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly made the appointment at the recommendation
of the Security Council, which last Friday unanimously agreed to
give a five-year term to Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council took that decision after the United States
insisted on vetoing a second term for 74-year old Boutros-Ghali,
whom they alleged slow in reforming the world body and too
enthusiastic about giving his visions on how to deal with the
international affairs.
