   SEATTLE _ When Susan McDougal was jailed by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, the onetime business partner of Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton received more encouraging letters and postcards from
Seattle than any single spot in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the cards had pictures of the city,'' she recalled in
an interview Friday. ``I was being held in isolation much of the
time. I used toothpaste to paste cards to the ceiling of my jail
cell. In that way, I could look up at blue sky and mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to McDougal, who spent 22 months in jail after
refusing to testify before Starr's grand juries, that far off in
the Northwest ``there was a city with a lot of like-minded
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place that supported me in a dark period of my
life,'' said McDougal, who has faced three criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, 44, and her attorney fiancee, Pat Harris, are thinking
of moving here and settling into what she described as ``a quiet
life in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, she must once more face Starr in court. McDougal
goes on trial March 8 in Arkansas, accused of contempt and
obstruction of justice for refusing to give grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she faces up to 14 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal and Harris are not only looking for a future home on
this their first trip to Seattle. They also are raising money for a
legal defense against Starr's $40 million investigative juggernaut.
The money-raising is spearheaded by the local author-activist team
of Walt Crowley and Marie McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming trial will be the second time that Starr has
brought criminal charges against McDougal. She was convicted in
1996 of charges involving a fraudulent loan. She was also acquitted
last November of charges in California that she embezzled money
from the wife of symphony conductor Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was picked in 1994 to investigate allegations of
impropriety involving a 1978 real estate investment whose partners
were the Clintons, McDougal, and her then-husband James McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal is convinced, however, that Starr's goal from the
start was to drive the president from office by manufacturing a
crime _ any crime _ or digging up episodes of sexual impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a criminal in mind,'' she said yesterday. ``They
wanted a crime. They needed people to give them a crime. ... I was
the glue in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known anything about them (the Clintons) engaging in
criminal behavior, I would have testified against them. It was just
that I wasn't going to make up a story about anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was greatest, added McDougal, as she faced
sentencing in the late summer of 1996, at the same time that
Clinton was in the midst of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, staring at a sentence of up to 84 years in prison,
James McDougal began to give evidence to Starr and approached his
former wife with a proposition that he said had come from Starr's
deputy, Hickman Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   With her voice unsteady, McDougal yesterday related her former
husband's words: ``If you'll come in to him (Ewing), all he
requires is that you say you had an affair with Bill Clinton. You
will not spend a day in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   (In his book, ``Arkansas Mischief,'' James McDougal confirms
that he had four or five conversations in which he urged his former
wife to cooperate with Starr. He mentions no sexual testimony, but
confirmed that he told her: ``You've got probation if you want it.
Just let me know.'')
</P>
<P>
   (Starr's office has denied any impropriety, saying that it used
normal prosecutorial tactics in trying to get a recalcitrant
witness to give evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   McDougal refused to testify. Cited for contempt, she was
photographed as she was led away to prison in a short gray skirt,
shackles and handcuffs. A first-time offender, she found herself
taken to court in cages and at times held in solitary confinement
23 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, she despises Starr. She refused to shake his
outstretched hand with the words, ``You've got to be kidding.'' She
has refused to even casually speak with Starr's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   She has also analyzed Starr, and sees him as not only a partisan
but a zealot. ``It is a moral question to him,'' she said. ``He
thinks Clinton is a bad guy. He is one of those persons who think
he can legislate morality to all the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal noted stories about Starr's religiosity, Sunday school
teaching, and that on morning jogs he sometimes sings hymns while
waiting for traffic lights to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real holy men are the rabbis and ministers I met in
prison, who were dedicating themselves to those who are alone and
suffering,'' she said. ``The real religious people didn't have to
tell you how good they are.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal has paid a stiff price for her defiance. She has
suffered from herniated discs. Severe back pain prompted a federal
judge to release her after the nearly two years in jail for
contempt, part of it spent in a 6-by-9 foot isolation cell.
</P>
<P>
   She remains, however, an ebullient and outspoken woman. She
laughs easily, gets emotional at times and has developed skills of
self-presentation and self-defense during four years of conflict
with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond prosecutions, McDougal wants to take up a new
cause _ the plight of women in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew as a human being enormously,'' she said. ``Just reading
my mail made me understand that I had done the right thing. It made
me less bitter, less angry and gave me a sense of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part of it is the women I was in prison with. I
never realized so many women had such lives. Most of them had no
family. I grew grateful for my life and for my family. ... I am a
better person, more open to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The last year has seen strange twists in what began as a
backwoods land transaction designed to give Arkansas' underpaid
attorney general (which Bill Clinton was at the time) a little
outside income.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has survived an impeachment trial on charges totally
unrelated to Whitewater. The president's popularity soared despite
an impeachment referral by Starr that seemed to dwell on steamy
sexual detail.
</P>
<P>
   James McDougal did not escape prison for cooperating with Starr.
Last March, he died at a federal medical prison in Texas. He
suffered a heart attack while in solitary confinement, with nobody
on hand to give him his nitroglycerin.
</P>
<P>
   Freed last July, Susan McDougal has beaten one criminal
indictment _ the California charges _ and seems ready to face the
upcoming trial in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As his lead (and hostile) witness, her defense attorney has
vowed to subpoena Starr and put him on the witness stand.
