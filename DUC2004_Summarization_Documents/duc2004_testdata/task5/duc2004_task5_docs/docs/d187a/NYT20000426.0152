   SAN FRANCISCO _ Susan McDougal, who spent 18 months in jail for
refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the
Whitewater affair, described a life behind bars that included rats,
roaches and drinking toilet water.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, 45, mixed pro-Clinton politics with her new found
activism as an advocate for prisoners during an address to 5,000
women gathered Tuesday at the Moscone Center for Mayor Willie
Brown's third annual women's summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dedicating my life to telling people what's going on in
your towns, in your jails,'' said McDougal, who spent eight months
of her jail time in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Her audience was a diverse mix of women and girls who attended
the daylong event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so hungry,'' McDougal, who has sought better treatment
of women prisoners since her release in 1998, said about the prison
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal served time in seven county jails in four states while
independent counsel Kenneth Starr investigated the Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton's investments with Susan and her former husband,
James McDougal, in the Whitewater real estate venture in Arkansas.
After spending 18 months behind bars for refusing to cooperate with
the federal investigation, McDougal was one of 14 people convicted
of fraud in connection with Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   She served less than four months of that two-year sentence
because of a back problem. A judge sentenced her to time served and
ordered her to spend 90 days in home detention.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater land deal occurred while Bill Clinton was
governor of Arkansas, but the federal investigation into wrongdoing
began after Clinton became president.
</P>
<P>
   James McDougal died in prison in March 1998 from ailing health.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a prominent Democrat and ally of the Clintons, called
McDougal a ``steel magnolia'' and a ``victim of Kenneth Starr's
vendetta'' as he introduced her at Tuesday's summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr set about destroying the president,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal said while she was in Arkansas jails, she drank water
out of a toilet tank, had to race rats and roaches to her meal tray
served in her solitary cell and slept on filthy floors.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, who was kept in isolation because of her celebrity
status, also said she witnessed how other inmates' physical and
mental illnesses went untreated.
</P>
<P>
   A few pregnant women, whose complaints of feeling ill were
ignored, suffered miscarriages, McDougal said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he invited McDougal to the summit because of the
bravery she showed during the Whitewater investigation and her
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Summit planner Caryl Ito added that McDougal's appeal as a
speaker was that ``she hasn't been heard very much. She's kind of a
curiosity, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Tuesday's summit was ``Bridges to Unleash
Opportunities,'' and the event included juvenile court Judge Glenda
Hatchett, the first black chief presiding judge in Georgia.
