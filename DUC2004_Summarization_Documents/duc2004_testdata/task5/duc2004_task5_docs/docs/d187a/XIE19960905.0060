<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Held in Contempt of Court </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. District Judge held
Susan McDougal in contempt of court Wednesday for refusing to
answer questions in front of the Whitewater grand jury in Little
Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered McDougal, who last month was
sentenced to two years in prison in a Whitewater probe, to report
to jail Monday where she will remain until she agrees to testify,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
McDougal's attorney, Bobby McDaniel, contends the independent
counsel wants her to testify against her former husband, James
McDougal, and their former business partners in the Whitewater
land deal, President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing after the grand jury session, McDougal read a
statement saying she was asked questions about her personal life
that she believed violated her right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
McDougal also said she might be subject to prosecution if she
did answer because her statements might not agree with testimony
from other witnesses questioned in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
McDougal was convicted on loan fraud charges in May for her
role in obtaining a 300,000-dollar loan in 1986 from a lending
company backed by the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
James McDougal reportedly is cooperating with prosecutors and
his sentencing has been postponed until November.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals were convicted along with former Arkansas
Governor Jim Guy Tucker on charges of misusing loan funds from
Capital Management Services and Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
Tucker received four years probation, including 18 months of
home detention, as doctors said he was suffering from a
life-threatening liver disease and would be denied a transplant if
he went to prison.
