<HEADLINE> McDougal Trial Targets Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In the opening hours of Susan  
McDougal's trial, prosecutor Kenneth Starr's message to the jury 
has seemed to be that he wants President Clinton to be the 
defendant as much as Clinton's former Whitewater business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors brandished their prize exhibit in the case --  
a $27,600 check from James and Susan McDougal's savings and loan 
made payable to ``Bill Clinton'' -- and juxtaposed it with the 
president's testimony that he'd never taken out a loan from the 
S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial features James McDougal speaking from the grave. The  
medium is one of Starr's investigators, FBI agent and accountant 
Mike Patkus, who has spent five years investigating Clinton. Patkus 
testified that McDougal tipped him in 1996 that there had been a 
loan to Clinton, contrary to what the president had said under 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus spent many days rummaging through the failed financial  
institution's records before he found the 1982 check to Clinton on 
microfilm. A garage mechanic later pulled the original from the 
trunk of a tornado-damaged car abandoned 10 years ago by a McDougal 
S&AMP;L employee who had brought the vehicle in for transmission 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be his last effort against the president, Starr is  
putting Mrs. McDougal on trial for criminal contempt and 
obstruction because she won't say what she knows about the Clinton 
loan. She endorsed a separate check that helped pay it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's overall investigation appears to be in its waning days,  
and departures are depleting his staff: The latest, spokesman 
Charles Bakaly, was knocked out this week in an investigation of a 
leak of information to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Robert Bittman has left for a law firm. Another  
deputy, Solomon Weisenberg, is doing likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors have even admitted in court that their  
investigation of the Clintons is at an impasse, possibly 
permanently, which is why they are putting Mrs. McDougal on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people with detailed information about the matters  
under investigation in Whitewater stands at three -- Susan McDougal 
and the Clintons, prosecutor Mark Barrett told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting Clinton as the invisible defendant is ``embarrassing and  
unfortunate'' for ``a sitting president, but this is the crime Mrs. 
McDougal is charged with and this is the government's proof,'' said 
St. John's University law professor John Barrett, a former 
Iran-Contra prosecutor and no relation to the prosecutor in the 
McDougal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the case is demonstrating that ``she was and is a  
relevant witness in this investigation of Clinton,'' said the law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	So far at the trial the prosecutors have said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Starr's FBI agents found a handwritten sheet among the S&AMP;L's  
records that calculated down to the penny the amount of money that 
Mrs. McDougal included in a check to help pay off the Clinton loan. 
A separate sheet in different handwriting and also buried in the 
institution's records listed the S&AMP;L's borrowers as including ``B 
Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- James McDougal told Starr's office that he had gotten Clinton  
to sign papers for the loan but McDougal destroyed the records 
after the loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There is a link between the Clinton loan and a fraudulent  
$300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 3 1/2 years later. The Clinton loan was 
paid off with another loan from the McDougals' S&AMP;L that listed 
Whitewater real estate salesman Chris Wade as the borrower. 
Whitewater's checking account provided funds to pay off the Wade 
loan. The Whitewater payment was covered with a bank loan, which in 
turn was paid off with the fraudulent loan to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Susan McDougal ever talk?  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, promises that she will, by taking the  
stand in her defense. If Geragos doesn't ask her about the Clinton 
loan, Starr's deputies promise that they will. 
</P>
<P>
	``She smiled ... like maybe she knows the answers,'' said Starr  
prosecutor Hickman Ewing, who has been watching Mrs. McDougal as 
she listens to Patkus testify.
