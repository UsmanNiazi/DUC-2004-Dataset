<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Trial Winding Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In her month-long trial, Susan McDougal  
got what she wanted: a judge, a jury and her lawyer in the room 
while she answered questions in Kenneth Starr's Whitewater 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were questions that she refused to answer in 1996 and again  
last year when Starr, the independent counsel, hauled her before 
grand juries to no avail. Instead she spent 18 months in jail for 
civil contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after closing arguments on Wednesday, jurors will consider  
Mrs. McDougal's defense that she feared being charged with perjury 
unless she gave Starr a story that she says he wanted to hear -- 
that the Clintons engaged in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who with her late husband was a partner with Bill  
and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater land deal, is charged with 
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final round of testimony Monday, Starr's office tried to  
show that it did everything possible to address her fears about 
giving grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Jahn, a former Starr prosecutor, said Mrs. McDougal was told  
in 1996 that if there came a point where there was a question about 
whether she'd committed perjury, the matter would be turned over to 
an independent prosecutor -- and not pursued by the Starr team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn denied prosecutors ever promised her relief from other  
legal problems if she cooperated or told her ex-husband -- as she 
claimed -- that she could ``write her own ticket'' if she said she 
had a sexual affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn acknowledged, however, that a state prosecutor in  
California had indicated an embezzlement case against Mrs. McDougal 
might be settled by plea bargain. She still refused to cooperate 
with Starr and Mrs. McDougal later was acquitted on the 
embezzlement charge. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Mrs. McDougal's defense got a boost when Judge  
George Howard Jr., allowed, despite strong protests from 
prosecutors, testimony from a Virginia woman who also claimed she 
had been mistreated by Starr prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan and I have been relentlessly pursued by the Office of  
Independent Counsel,'' testified Julie Hiatt Steele, who claimed 
she had been indicted because she refused to give false testimony 
against Clinton. Steele faces a trial next month on an indictment 
obtained by Starr's staff that she obstructed justice and lied to a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal used her trial to dramatically press her attack on  
Starr whom she accused of waging a ``personal vendetta'' against 
her. ``It will be an all-out fight,'' she predicted as the trial 
opened March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	When she took the stand two weeks into the trial, McDougal said  
she never discussed a fraudulent $300,000 loan with Bill Clinton -- 
that has been the center of the Whitewater investigation -- and that 
she did not believe Clinton had said ``anything untruthful'' when 
he testified at her 1996 trial involving the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he said was untrue to me,'' said McDougal from the  
stand, for the first time addressing questions she for 2 1/2 years had 
refused to address for Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal contempt and obstruction case centers on Mrs.  
McDougal's state of mind when she refused to cooperate with Starr, 
her defense lawyers argued, because she believed her own words 
would be used against her by Starr's prosecutors even if she told 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	A career federal prosecutor, Jahn insisted Monday that the Starr  
prosecutors only wanted Mrs. McDougal to tell the ``total and 
complete truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what Mrs. McDougal claims, added Associate Independent  
Counsel Mark Barrett, the government has only to show that she 
disobeyed a court order to answer the grand jury questions.
