<HEADLINE> Whitewater Figure Acquitted in Embezzlement Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater figure Susan
McDougal was acquitted on Monday of embezzling from conductor
Zubin Mehta and his wife, a case she said was trumped up to
pressure her to testify against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The jury in the trial in California, acquitted her on all
counts, including forgery and failure to pay state income taxes,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
McDougal, 44, was accused of stealing from Mehta and his wife,
Nancy, when she worked as bookkeeper and personal assistant to
Mrs. Mehta from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The case took five years to get to trial. McDougal had
steadfastly refused to testify against her friend Clinton before
the Whitewater federal grand jury -- a decision that cost her 18
months in jail for contempt.
</P>
<P>
In addition, McDougal served more than three months of a
two-year sentence in a Whitewater-related loan fraud case. She was
released because of a painful back condition.
</P>
<P>
Also convicted were her late ex-husband James McDougal and
former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker. She still faces
prosecution in Arkansas for her refusal to testify in the
Whitewater case.
</P>
<P>
In the California case, Defense lawyer Mark Geragos said
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had promised to make the
embezzlement charges go away if McDougal would testify. When she
refused, he alleged, Starr "propped up" the case and urged
prosecutors to move on the defendant, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jurors had said they knew of McDougal's standoff with Starr but
agreed to ignore it.
