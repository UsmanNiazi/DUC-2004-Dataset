SUSAN MCDOUGAL FREED FROM PRISON BY FEDERAL JUDGE IN LITTLE ROCK

   WASHINGTON _ Susan McDougal, the embattled Whitewater figure who
suffered incarceration rather than answer grand jury questions
about Bill and Hillary Clinton, was unexpectedly ordered freed from
prison by a federal judge in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives wept as Mrs. McDougal offered a dazed smile at the
sudden decision by U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr., taken
after she insisted that her previous 21 months of imprisonment had
severely aggravated a spinal condition. The judge, saying he was
motivated by ``compassion and mercy,'' reduced her sentence to time
served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still so stunned,'' Mrs. McDougal said when she finally
emerged to freedom outside the courthouse, 90 minutes after the
decision. ``I just don't know what to say,'' she exulted, still in
her two-piece bright orange prison uniform, looking physically wan,
but ebullient in spirit. ``I still don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling eliminated the remainder of a two-year prison
sentence she began serving in March for her conviction in the first
Whitewater trial on charges of mail fraud, misapplication of funds
and making false statements. Taking into account the 18 months of
separate jail time she had served for resisting the grand jury
investigation of the Clintons, the judge ruled that she be freed
from the fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also ordered that in 10 days, she must begin a
90-day period of home detention at her parents' house in Camden,
Ark., under electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a much better person today than the one you sentenced,''
Mrs. McDougal told the judge. ``I promise you, you won't be
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Her troubles with the courts and Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, were hardly ended by the ruling, for Mrs.
McDougal was re-indicted by Starr last month for once more refusing
to answer grand jury questions about the Clintons and Whitewater.
That trial, on charges of criminal contempt and obstruction of
justice, is set for Sept. 28 in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Mrs. McDougal faces an unrelated criminal trial on
July 13 in California on charges that she embezzled $150,000 from
the music conductor Zubin Mehta when she worked as his bookkeeper
from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal was not immediately freed after the decision as
federal marshals indicated they had to sort out her bail status in
the face of the charges still pending. Her mother, Laura Henley,
indicated that Mrs. McDougal might spend the night in a Little Rock
hotel but was soon expected home under the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take her home so bad,'' Mrs. Henley said, beaming
and teary-eyed outside the Little Rock courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Throeeh her travail, Mrs. McDougal has maintained a combative
resistance to Starr and his attempts to link the Clintons to
criminal activity in the decade-old complex of real estate and
political events known as Whitewater. She stood firm in leg irons
and high heels as she was led off the first time for her silence
and her supporters opened an Internet web site (www.stopstarr.org)
that portrayed her as a martyr to prosecutorial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resign and I'll answer all their questions,'' she said
defiantly to prosecutors in her second contempt struggle with
Starr, insisting he had numerous conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Howard issued his decision after hearing testimony from Dr.
Ronald Fisk, a clinical neurologist at the University of California
at Los Angeles that Mrs. McDougal was suffering seriously
progressive curvature of the spine and related disk problems that
may require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, noted that criminal contempt
charges were still pending against Mrs. McDougal. ``The judge made
a compassioned decision based on medical testimony to release Mrs.
McDougal, and we respect the judge's decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly rebuffed the independent counsel
team, accusing Starr of bias in his investigation of President
Clinton's affairs during his gubernatorial years in Arkansas. In
her re-indictment last month, prosecutors charged that after Mrs.
McDougal was granted immunity and compelled to testify by a federal
judge, she failed to answer questions posed by prosecutors and
grand jurors, contending that the prosecutors were prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
   The questions covered whether Clinton had testified truthfully
at Ms. McDougal's criminal trial, the nature of Mrs. Clinton's
legal work on behalf of a corrupt Arkansas savings association
owned by Mrs. McDougal's former husband, and the Clintons'
knowledge of an improperly financed land deal that was supposed to
bail out the Whitewater Development Company in which they had
invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to answer the grand jury's questions,'' Mrs.
McDougal declared, according to her jury testimony denouncing the
prosecutors. ``But they don't have anyone in here that will take
this investigation where it should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain she had no legal basis for refusing to
answer questions central to the investigation. They sought to
cross-examine her about the version of Whitewater events and
denials offered by Clinton in his videotaped deposition at her
trial. Nor would she say whether she had a discussion with Clinton
about an improper loan issued in 1986 by David Hale, a former
municipal judge who ran an investment company backed by the Small
Business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has testified that Clinton, when he was governor of
Arkansas, asked him to issue an unlawful $300,000 loan that paid
for some Whitewater expenses. Clinton has denied under oath that he
knew about the loan or played any role in obtaining it.
</P>
<P>
   Laced through Mrs. McDougal's struggle with Starr has been the
parallel, at times conflicting version of events left by her former
husband, Jim McDougal, who died earlier this year, who also was
convicted on Whitewater charges. Criticized as a colorful
prevaricator, McDougal made charges, denied by the president, that
Mrs. McDougal was once Clinton's lover and that the president had
privately agreed to grant her a pardon if she were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   After her release, Mark Barrett, an associate independent
counsel, emphasized that the government had offered no opposition
to Mrs. McDougal's motion to be allowed her freedom on her own
recognizance, pending her next contempt trial.
</P>
<P>
   With all her remaining legal problems, Mrs. McDougal was in high
spirits on the Little Rock sidewalk as she tasted her first freedom
since September 1996. Her attorney, Mark Geragos, said, ``Without a
doubt it was more than I expected.'' He escorted her away to ``get
her some clothes'' other than a prison uniform.
