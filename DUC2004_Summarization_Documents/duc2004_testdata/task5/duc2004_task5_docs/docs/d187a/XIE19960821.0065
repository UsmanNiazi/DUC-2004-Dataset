<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Gets Two Years in Whitewater Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Susan McDougal, former wife
of one-time Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan President James
McDougal, was sentenced today to two years in prison in the
Whitewater case.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. in Little Rock, Arkansas,
also ordered her to serve three years probation after her prison
time, pay 300,000 dollars plus interest to the Small Business
Administration and a 5,000 dollar fine, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Howard denied a request by Mrs. McDougal's attorney that she be
allowed to remain free pending the outcome of her appeal. She was
ordered to report to prison on September 30. She faced up to 17
years in prison and 1 million dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
Howard handed down the sentence after hearing about an hour of
testimony about Mrs. McDougal's job history, which prosecutors
argued showed "a pattern of defeat" and repeated misleading
statements.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal, 41, was convicted of obtaining a 300,000-dollar
loan from Capital Management Service, the small business lending
company operated by key government witness David Hale. She signed
the loan application.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal said she was never aware of the basis for the
loan application, which the government contended was false.
Prosecutors say the funds were used to pay McDougal bills instead
of financing a new business for her.
</P>
<P>
McDougal, her former husband, and former Arkansas Governor Jim
Guy Tucker were convicted on May 28 on fraud and conspiracy charges
in the first Whitewater case to come to trial.
</P>
<P>
Tucker was sentenced Monday to four years probation as the
former Arkansas governor is awaiting a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
Tucker also was ordered to repay a 1986 Small Business
Administration loan and interest amounting to nearly 300,000
dollars. He also was fined 25,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
James McDougal's sentencing was postponed until November 18,
appearing to confirm published reports that he is cooperating with
Whitewater investigators. The judge has ordered McDougal and
attorneys not to discuss the delay.
</P>
<P>
He could face up to 84 years in prison and 4.5 million dollars
in fines.
