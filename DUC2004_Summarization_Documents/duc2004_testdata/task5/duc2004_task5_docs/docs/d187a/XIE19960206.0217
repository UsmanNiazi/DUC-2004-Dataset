<HEADLINE> U.S. President to Be Subpoenaed to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge on Monday
granted a defendant's request to subpoena U.S. President Bill
Clinton to testify at the trial of James and Susan McDougal, his
former partners in a failed Arkansas land deal.
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to begin on March 4 in Little Rock,
Arkansas, according to wire services.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal is accused of receiving a loan that a former
Little Rock businessman and municipal judge, David Hale, says
Clinton pressured him to make. Clinton, who has not been charged,
has denied the accusation, and said he doesn't recall talking to
Hale about money.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals and Governor Jim Guy Tucker, who has other
business dealings with the McDougals, face trial on conspiracy and
fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. approved the subpoena on
behalf of both the McDougals, directing their lawyers to proceed
in a way that does not interfere with the president's official
duties.
</P>
<P>
If a personal appearance cannot be arranged, the judge said,
the McDougals' lawyers should consider either videotaped testimony
or an appearance by satellite.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the testimony of the president was relevant and
vital if the McDougals are to receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena was still being prepared Monday afternoon and is
expected to be submitted to the clerk of the court for signing
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals were the owners of the now-defunct Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loans before it failed in the late 1980s and
were partners with the Clintons in Whitewater, a real estate
development deal in northern Arkansas.
