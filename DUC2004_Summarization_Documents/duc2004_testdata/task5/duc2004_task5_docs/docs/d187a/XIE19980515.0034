<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Pleads Innocent in Obstruction of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal
pleaded innocent Thursday to accusations that she obstructed
justice by refusing to talk to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal said only "Not guilty" before U.S. Magistrate H.
David Young in Little Rock, Arkansas. Trial on charges of criminal
contempt and obstruction of justice was set for June 22. Lawyers
said they expect the trial to last three weeks, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal, 43, was charged for refusing to answer
Whitewater grand jury questions about the president.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, she was convicted on four fraud counts and
sentenced to two years in prison. Then Arkansas Governor Jim Guy
Tucker and Mrs. McDougal's ex-husband, James McDougal, also were
convicted in the Whitewater trial, spearheaded by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal refused to answer questions about President Bill
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton before the Whitewater grand
jury, and U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found her in
civil contempt.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal completed an 18-month stint in prison for the
civil contempt citation. Then in March, she began serving the
two-year sentence on the criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, after two years of investigation, disbanded
earlier this month. Its only indictment included the latest
criminal charges against Mrs. McDougal, again for refusing to
answer questions in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, Mark Geragos of Los Angeles, maintains Starr is
trying to bully his client.
