   AUSTIN, Texas _ On a wall of Karl Rove's office at George W.
Bush's campaign headquarters hangs an editorial cartoon from a
local newspaper that pretty much says it all.
</P>
<P>
   The multipanel strip shows Bush, a would-be president, and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a would-be senator, squabbling over
ownership of a narrow political spotlight. Each stakes a claim.
Each grows petulant. Then Bush plays his trump card.
</P>
<P>
   He hollers for Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Readers outside Texas might not understand the reference, but in
a few months they probably will. If Bush lopes to the Republican
nomination as decisively as many of his advisers and supporters
believe he can, Rove will be hailed well beyond this state's
boundaries as a political mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush limps or stumbles? That is not a possibility Rove is
willing to entertain, and the business of creating ample insurance
against it is what keeps a cell phone affixed to his ear, campaign
aides lined up patiently at his office door and a sometimes frantic
edge in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked so hard in my life,'' he said recently
during a rare quiet moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, a longtime political operative in Texas, where many
Republicans attribute their current domination of the political
scene to his influence, is Bush's chief strategist. And while he
officially has no more power or influence than Bush's other top
advisers, campaign aides say Rove is first among equals. Bush
readily tagged him as the sire of the campaign's shape, pacing and
densely staffed organizations in states with early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl gets credit for being the architect of it,'' Bush said in
an interview, ``and he should.''
</P>
<P>
   But, tellingly, Bush lavished more effusive praise on Rove for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most about Karl is that he cares about me as
a person,'' Bush said. ``He's got a single agenda when it comes to
my campaigns, and that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rove, who sold an extremely profitable consulting
business, at Bush's request, typifies the devotion that Bush
expects and receives from his closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The three at the heart of the operation _ Rove; Joe Allbaugh,
the campaign manager, and Karen Hughes, the communications director
_ have all worked with Bush in Texas since his first, successful
race for governor in 1994, and they are known around the state as
the ``iron triangle'' for their proximity to, and protectiveness
of, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Allbaugh, with his beefy build and Marine-style buzz cut,
disciplines Bush's staff and watches over the purse strings with a
drill sergeant's intensity. Ms. Hughes, her eyes ablaze with true
belief, hangs on Bush's words, and she laughs the loudest whenever
he cracks a joke.
</P>
<P>
   And Rove, well, he has his fingers in everything, and everything
has his fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   This tight-lipped, tightly bound trio and the ethos of loyalty
they represent have helped the Bush campaign roar down the tracks
without many of the leaks, internal dissents, power grabs and
preening that frequently derail candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them has ever attempted anything so big before, and
their profound, palpable affection for Bush raises questions about
whether they see him clearly and dispassionately enough to
recognize problems before they become crises or to give him the
advice he needs for a contest with dramatically raised stakes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, political consultants in Texas said that Bush's
cautious adherence to scripted remarks all last year _ and his
seeming avoidance of some controversial issues _ were telltale
attributes of a Rove-counseled candidacy and holdovers from Bush's
campaigns for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But while those designs helped him in his statewide races, they
did him little good in his early debates, as he stumbled over
questions about the books he had read or the nation's relationship
to China. Before long, some Republican officials were questioning
his abilities as a candidate and Bush himself was battling an image
as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is Karl's trademark, it's message discipline, and
he gets everybody sharing that discipline,'' said Chuck McDonald, a
Democratic consultant in Austin who worked for Gov. Ann Richards
when she lost her 1994 re-election bid to Bush. ``They're going to
do things the way they laid out their game plan, and that's not
going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a presidential campaign, McDonald added, ``It seems to me
that you have to throw some passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove and other aides also watched Bush's lead in New Hampshire
evaporate as they paid less attention to the state than did his
chief Republican rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Rove said that
it was not purely a matter of choice, because Bush's status as the
front-runner compelled him to campaign everywhere, while McCain
could pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Bush supporters in New Hampshire charged Rove and
others with overconfidence, and Bush is now in New Hampshire more
often than before.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Rove has seemingly made few mistakes. McDonald and
other consultants noted that when Rove set up shop in Austin two
decades ago, Democrats held the lion's share of statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republicans do, ``and they're all Karl's candidates,''
McDonald said, adding: ``I admire him, because it's awfully lonely
to be a Republican consultant when there are no Republican
officeholders. That's how it started for him, and that's how it is
for Democratic consultants now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's ties to the Bush family go back even further. In the
early 1970s, when Rove was a student active with the College
Republicans, he became friendly with another rising political
operative, Lee Atwater, who went on to serve as the principal
strategist for the successful 1988 presidential bid of Bush's
father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Atwater was the southern coordinator for Rove's
campaign for chairman of the College Republicans in 1973. Rove won.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rove came under investigation by the Republican National
Committee after accusations that he had been supervising seminars
for college students on how to use ``dirty tricks'' in campaigns.
After the committee exonerated him, its chairman at the time,
Bush's father, gave Rove a job as his special assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Rove met George W. Bush, who swept
into Washington on a break from business school at Harvard
University. Rove was entrusted with giving Bush the keys to the
family car.
</P>
<P>
   Of that first encounter with Bush, Rove said that he recalled
``huge amounts of charisma, swagger, cowboy boots, flight jacket,
wonderful smile, just charisma _ you know, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rove talks about Bush, he radiates a regard for him that
goes beyond professional obligation or selfish investment in Bush's
fortune. It is more like a crush, both platonic and political, and
it underscores the oddness of this particular couple: the pale,
intense, bookish Rove and the ruddy, easygoing, folksy Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, I couldn't believe how good a candidate he was,'' Rove
said. ``Then, once he got into office, it just blew my mind.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   That mind, by all accounts and evidence, is a staggeringly
active one, stoked constantly by the thousands of thick volumes of
prose (almost all of it nonfiction) that he owns. These books are
carefully organized in his home study: political philosophy in one
section, the musings of Thomas Jefferson in another, the collected
works of Winston Churchill nearby. The walls around them are
adorned with vintage photographs and portraits of American
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is so interested in history that he literally lives in it,
although that was not easy to arrange: He and his second wife,
Darby, a graphic artist, found the late 19th-century Texas
farmhouse of their dreams on a rural road far from Austin and had
it split into three pieces so that it could be moved 100 miles and
reassembled on a hill outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, 49, grew up in various states along the Rocky Mountains,
where his father's career as a geologist took the family. He
attended the University of Utah and George Mason University in
Virginia, but never received a college degree; he said he was too
distracted by, and preoccupied with, the political work he was
doing on the side.
</P>
<P>
   One summer, in an early indication of his killer instincts, Rove
got hold of some stationery with a Democratic candidate's
letterhead on it, forged an invitation promising ``free food, girls
and a good time'' at the candidate's headquarters and distributed
hundreds of the invitations to poor and homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that such mischief is behind him, but some political
peers said that a ruthless competitive spirit is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who gets in the way of his ambitions for the governor
gets run off,'' said Tom Pauken, a former chairman of the
Republican Party in Texas. ``And if you're not with Karl 100
percent, you're an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald put it more diplomatically. ``Karl plays as fair as
anybody else in politics,'' he said, ``but he plays for keeps. I
always knew where I stood with Karl. I knew he was trying to kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's peers say that he is a master at creating a sense of
momentum, and they credit him with orchestrating the thick parade
of Republican luminaries to the governor's mansion in Austin and
the seemingly endless rollout of endorsements while Bush stayed off
the campaign trail last winter and spring, creating a keen sense of
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, some of it was Bush's salesmanship,'' said Charles
Black, a Republican strategist in Washington. But, Black said,
``Karl's ability to use Austin as a base and organize the country
from there was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove has overseen the Bush campaign's effort in every
early-primary state to identify _ by phone, home visits and other
means _ potential supporters of Bush, and to try to ascertain that
Bush has the necessary votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   That is a vestige of Rove's extensive, earlier work in
direct-mail consulting. It is also where a good chunk of Bush's
financial war chest has gone, and it could ultimately prove more
critical to victory than the dazzling aspects of campaigning that
attract public notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl's a meticulous planner,'' said Stuart Stevens, one of the
Bush campaign's principal media advisers. Stevens remembered
watching Rove, in a coffeehouse in Austin in April, map out the
Bush effort for the rest of the year on the only kind of paper
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five napkins later, you had the structure of an entire
presidential campaign,'' Stevens said. ``Then Karl just left. I
went back to get the napkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove has put boundless energy and thought into Bush's political
ascent _ at Rove's consulting firm there was always a special, red
phone for Bush's incoming calls _ and he has sacrificed for it.
</P>
<P>
   He once had a lucrative consulting contract with the tobacco
industry, but he gave it up when it became an embarrassing
political situation for the Texas governor. He was once his own
boss, with his own eponymous business, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   And after a few episodes in which he seemed to upstage and upset
Bush, he learned to bury his ego, to belittle his own
contributions. Much as Ms. Hughes kept her name off the cover of
the autobiography of Bush that she wrote, Rove spent considerable
time during interviews deferring to Bush as the real political
genius, the leader whose insights are the most vital, whose
interests can never be promoted too zealously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my friend,'' Rove said. ``He's my friend, and I love
him.''
