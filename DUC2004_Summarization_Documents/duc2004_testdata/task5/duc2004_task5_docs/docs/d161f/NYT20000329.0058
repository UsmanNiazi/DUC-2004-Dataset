   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when campaign finances are a
ballyhooed issue in the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush's
chief political strategist is a featured speaker Friday for a group
that is under fire for its fund-raising to help elect Republican
attorneys general across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Strategist Karl Rove is scheduled to give a political briefing
to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), which meets
at the Barton Creek Resort here Thursday and Friday. The meeting is
closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A Thursday reception that had been scheduled at the Governor's
Mansion, which the Bush presidential campaign said the governor
never planned to attend, has been moved to a restaurant. The
association said the restaurant is larger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Vice President Al Gore for the
Democrat's past fund-raising problems. Both candidates have said
they want to change campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Two watchdog groups that look at campaign finances, the Center
for Public Integrity and Texans for Public Justice, criticized RAGA
for soliciting corporate donations and not disclosing specifically
who donates.
</P>
<P>
   Donations to the association, which is part of the Republican
National Committee, are reported to the Federal Election Commission
by the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog groups contend that the corporate donors are at
least potentially gaining influential allies and access, including
access to Rove.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans dismissed the criticism as ridiculous
and said attorneys general would not hold back from prosecuting
lawbreakers due to contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters also noted that the group is separate from
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl was invited to give a political briefing. That's the
extent of his involvement,'' said Scott McClellan, a Bush campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rove has been a campaign consultant to two attorneys general who
led the Republican association, including Texas Attorney General
John Cornyn, said RNC press secretary Mike Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl was speaking to groups like this before Bush was even
governor. He is well-respected and well-known in his own right,''
added Ray Sullivan, spokesman for Texas Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, also a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned the credibility of the watchdog groups, noting
in part that Texans for Public Justice refuses to disclose its
donors. Both the Texas group and the Washington-based Center for
Public Integrity describe themselves as nonprofit and non-partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, speaking for the attorneys general association, also
contended the Democratic Governors' Association has been more
secretive in its fund-raising, partly because it files its reports
state-by-state rather than with the Federal Election Commission.
George Shelton of the Democratic group said that is what it is
required to do.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC goes beyond what is required by federal law by filing
its reports monthly, said Collins. The attorneys general
association has raised $525,000 since it was formed a year ago, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has helped solicit association members, who pay $5,000 to
$25,000 or more to belong, according to a mailing sent to
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Attorneys General Association was born out of
concerns arising out of recent industry-wide lawsuits that seek to
promote policy changes via the courthouse rather than the
statehouse,'' said a letter signed by Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn added in a Tuesday statement, ``As attorney general, I
will always take action against those who have broken the law. No
exceptions. No excuses.''

   An article by Marianne Holt and Kathryn Wallace posted on the
Web site of the Center for Public Integrity said: ``At the very
least, association with RAGA could give businesses advance word of
costly state-prosecuted lawsuits, such as claims against the
tobacco industry that cost the industry some $246 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, corporations that join RAGA secure potential allies
in the White House and advocates in the offices of attorneys
general who could discourage joining in such litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice said of the GOP
attorneys general, ``It appears they are selling immunity to large
corporate contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   He said for Rove to participate is unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is happening, it appears RAGA is not only selling
immunity from attorneys general but also selling access to what
might be the new White House,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn lashed back at McDonald's group, calling it ``a secretive
front group for the trial lawyers, who don't like that I've stood
for conservative principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponents practice politics by litigation and want to
further enrich themselves by using the power of the state against
law-abiding citizens. I believe that I should fairly enforce the
law, not make social policy through the courthouse,'' Cornyn said.
