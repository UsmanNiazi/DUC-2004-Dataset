 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    George W. Bush had just nailed down the Republican Party's
presidential nomination with his Super Tuesday primary victories,
and in Texas it was a night to celebrate. Yet the winner's top
strategist, Karl Rove, moved uncomfortably through the victory bash
at the Four Seasons in Austin that evening.
 &HT;    ``The king has arrived!'' someone shouted at Rove, and the king
winced. When Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly, knelt
before him with a flourish and pretended to kiss his ring, Rove
turned around, bent over at the waist and hiked up his jacket. As
in, ``Kiss this.''
 &HT;    Rove was laughing, of course. Everyone was. But bristling, too,
not so far underneath, at even this celebratory moment. When I
asked him if he was enjoying himself, he said no. ``Boring, man,
boring,'' he yelled, raising his voice to make himself heard.
 &HT;    He didn't seem so much bored, though, as thrown by all the
attention _ particularly the positive stuff. As his wife, Darby,
later remarked, ``He knows they can turn on you at any time.''
 &HT;    It was Rove who hatched the whole concept of the Bush campaign,
starting with the parade of Republicans who showed up in Austin
begging the governor to run. But after Bush lost to Sen. John
McCain in New Hampshire and later in Michigan, there was widespread
panic among campaign contributors and plenty of grousing from Daddy
Bush's old team: what did this Rove really know about running a
national campaign?
 &HT;    The question hasn't gone away either. In his own party, he is
seen by many as both too inexperienced and too smitten by his
candidate to be of much use. Yet the story here is not ``Jethro
Runs a Presidential Campaign.''
 &HT;    In the last 20 years, Rove has run and won most every major
Republican campaign in Texas, and he has been relentless in the
service of his clients and their conservative cause. And if some of
his cutthroat, cowboy image is hype _ he is awfully eager to talk
about his old buddy Lee Atwater's profound influence on his life _
the least that can be said is that it's hype that has worked. In
Austin, his hometown, he is generally regarded as either: a) a
genius, or b) an evil genius, with a subspecialty in screaming,
over-the-top phone calls about perceived betrayals, usually of
George W.
 &HT;    When I started to ask him about the phone calls recently, he cut
me off: ``Somebody who had done the wrong thing with somebody I was
working for? You bet. Somebody out there bad-mouthing? You bet I'll
chew on them. You bet I get in their face.'' His anger is real
enough.
 &HT;    And when I brought up the talk about his experience being too
provincial, his response again was pretty macho: ``No, I haven't
run a national campaign, but who has? Jim Baker?'' This he said as
if being James Baker, who reluctantly ran President Bush's 1992
campaign, is maybe not such a good thing.
 &HT;    Rove said he would, of course, be bringing in reinforcements,
and already, a number of better-known operatives, including Haley
Barbour and Mary Matalin, have been hired to lend advice. Yet Rove
could not help adding, sneeringly: ``But do you repopulate the
campaign with people from 1908? No!''
 &HT;    There are other concerns about Rove: he cannot hope to maintain
airtight message control _ the hallmark of his earlier campaigns,
including W.'s gubernatorial runs _ in the circus atmosphere of a
presidential race. And quite possibly, Rove's arrogance and his
tendency to take politics personally are not the ideal check on
Bush's arrogance and tendency to take politics personally.
 &HT;    But Republicans can stop worrying that Karl Rove is too
down-home, laid-back, blissed out or otherwise insufficiently
aggressive for the job. At one point during that big evening at the
Four Seasons, Rove retreated to a hotel suite upstairs to crunch
numbers and monitor TV chat.
 &HT;    He phoned the Bush campaign's communications director, Karen
Hughes, to tell her what to say on the air. (Earlier, he had also
told her what to tell Bush to say.) Then he disappeared into the
bathroom with his cell phone to take a call from Bush.
 &HT;    Rove and his boss had been on the phone throughout the day, and
from his office at Bush central that afternoon, he gave Bush the
good news from the exit polls, taking special pleasure in the
McCain campaign ``meltdown,'' as he called it.
 &HT;    Just as Rove finished talking to Bush from the hotel bathroom
that evening, boisterous, good-natured Karen Hughes burst into the
suite, and Rove told her he just wanted to ``get New York over with
so we can go home.'' ``Go home?'' Hughes yelled. ``I want to
celebrate.'' Rove sighed, and she rubbed his shoulders for a
minute. ``Congratulations,'' she told him _ quietly, for her. As
in, could you try to enjoy it a little?
 &HT;    They hovered near the TV, and when Bush finally came on CNN,
Hughes marveled at how well he was performing. Rove, though, was
still frowning. And when Bernard Shaw asked the governor whether,
``if you were to win the delegates in California but lose the
popular vote,'' McCain might conceivably stay in the race, Rove
bellowed at the screen: ``Hey, what if we win both? Will you --''
Then he said something that was not ``kiss my ring.''
 &HT;    You won't be seeing any gauzy, feel-good clips from Karl Rove's
early life in a campaign video at the convention this summer. Dad _
his adoptive dad _ was gone a lot, working. Mom moved the family
around, restless. The kid missed him, fought with her. Finally Dad
left for good. On a Christmas Day, actually. Then Mom packed for
Reno. And later, when he was all grown up, she killed herself.
 &HT;    ``Nothing special about the Roves,'' Karl summed up defiantly
when asked some pap question about where he had grown up. (Answer:
Out West, Colorado mostly, though he went to high school in Salt
Lake City.) At 49, all round and successful and stressed out by the
right things now, Rove sat in his Austin office and looked back on
his younger self as a ``strange kid'' who grew into a ``big nerd,
complete with the pocket protector, briefcase, the whole deal.''
 &HT;    He loved history and books of all kinds, really, and spent most
of his free time in the library, preparing for his debating-team
competitions. His debating partner and best friend in Salt Lake
City, Mark Dangerfield, now an attorney in Phoenix, said that one
thing that really seemed to bother his friend back then was that
``he was raised in a completely nonreligious home.''
 &HT;    When I asked Rove about this, he said: ``I'm not sure I've ever
found faith. Others here'' _ others in the campaign, including
George W. _ ``I know how much their faith sustains them.'' At some
point, politics, conservative politics, became Rove's true religion
_ though his family wasn't Republican or in any way political, for
that matter.
 &HT;    And right from the beginning, he saw politics as a contact
sport: ``The little girl across the street I can remember beating
the hell out of me in 1960 because I was for Nixon and she was for
Kennedy. She had a couple of years and a few pounds on me, and I
can remember being on the pavement.'' He volunteered for one of the
campaigns of Wallace F. Bennett, the Utah senator, while still in
high school, and essentially he never came off the trail.
 &HT;    College was off and on: Rove began at the University of Utah in
1969, thinking of majoring in political science, but after his
parents split up during his freshman year, he says, ``I had to
start to fend for myself.'' To earn money for school, he worked in
a convenience store and was robbed at gunpoint. And he never did
get a degree, still a tender spot with him.
 &HT;    Darby Rove is a graphic artist who worked for her husband's
political direct-mail business before they were married, and over a
long lunch earlier this spring she was both admiring and bracingly
frank about him. She called him a creative genius and a committed
father to their 11-year-old son, Andrew, but also said he can be
fierce and quite intimidating, even when he's trying not to be.
 &HT;    It isn't only that he's always working, she said, but that
working for Republicans is the organizing principle of his life, at
the center of his world, which he tends to divide into friends and
foes. ``I told Karl the other day,'' she said, '''You see things in
black and white. I see lots of gray.'''
 &HT;    Rove does have a softer side; when I mentioned how much I had
liked his wife, who has had a long battle with breast cancer, his
eyes filled with tears. ``She is one of the most courageous people
I know,'' he said. But as she suggested, he does talk a lot about
the forces of good and evil. Even in the race he ran to head the
College Republicans in his early 20s, he and his allies were ``the
good guys'' and his opponent and his opponent's supporters were
``the bad guys.''
 &HT;    Atwater, his fellow College Republican, fixed it so that he'd
win that campaign, Rove says. Nothing too nefarious, though, just
charming some women, who even in that election turned out to be the
swing voters. Afterward, Rove hired Atwater to help him in the job,
his first real job. And they traveled the country together,
recruiting college kids. This was smack in the middle of Watergate
_ not exactly go-go years for campus Republicans.
 &HT;    But the thing that came across most plainly as Rove talked about
his work, then and now, is the sense that he is absolutely
unafraid. So is he like Atwater? ``I guess I'm more cerebral and
lack his great people skills,'' Rove said. ``And I'm more of a
nerd. Lee was a nerd in high school, but then he learned to play
the guitar and talk to girls, and I never did.'' They both met
George Bush in that job, of course, and his son George W., too. And
both Rove and Atwater ended up going to work for the elder Bush _
Rove down in Texas, where he has been ever since.
 &HT;    When I asked people who have worked with Rove in Texas what
makes a classic ``Karl campaign,'' they all used the same word:
control. He picks a few campaign themes and goes to great pains to
keep his candidates on message. A year before Bush first ran for
governor, against Ann Richards in 1994, he was invited to
participate in a little skit being put on by a Republican women's
group in Dallas, and Rob Allyn, a Republican consultant who was
working on the event, got a call from Rove.
 &HT;    ``He said Bush would make fun of himself, his mother or
whatever,'' Allyn recalled recently, ``but he would not under any
circumstances make fun of Ann Richards and would appear only on
that condition.''
 &HT;    There are also a lot of stories of Rove's bullying on behalf of
Bush. Frank Cahoon, one of the first Republicans ever elected to
the Texas House (he is now retired from politics and living in
Midland) heard from Rove after Cahoon openly disagreed with some of
the appointments Bush made upon being elected governor. He called
one Sunday night and went on for an hour, Cahoon recalled: ``Karl
was reading me the riot act as a traitor. I said, 'Who cares what
some old man out here in the desert thinks?'''
 &HT;    Rove also tries to keep the press in line. When an Austin
publication, The Lone Star Report, ran negative stories about the
governor's tax plan in 1997, Rove not only called to complain but
also yelled for 45 minutes straight. ``I was sitting 10 feet away''
from the guy who took the call, said the current managing editor,
David Guenthner, ``and I could hear every word.''
 &HT;    A friend of mine in Texas, Anne Marie Kilday, a former colleague
at The Dallas Morning News, says Rove called her at home early one
morning during Bush's race against Richards. Republicans had been
shopping a story about supposed malfeasance by a female state
official Kilday covered. According to Kilday, Rove said he was
looking over the telephone records of this official, who is a
lesbian, and said he found it interesting that there had been a
number of calls to Kilday from the official ``at your residence.''
Kilday recalled, ``He said, 'You've just got to be careful about
your reputation and what people might think.'''
 &HT;    When I asked Rove about the story without mentioning names, he
said: ``I have no recollection of that. I know exactly who it is,
though.'' The official's sexuality, he said, would have had nothing
to do with it. ``I would never have had that conversation,'' he
said.
 &HT;    Probably the weirdest story about Rove-related intrigue goes
back to 1986, when he was working for Bill Clements, a Republican
and a former governor, in his run against Gov. Mark White.
Literally hours before the two were supposed to debate for the
first and only time in that race, the big news broke that a
listening device had been discovered in Rove's office, hidden
behind a red, white and blue needlepoint of the GOP elephant.
 &HT;    An investigation came to nothing, but the incident infuriated
White's people, who accused Rove of planting the bug himself to
distract the White camp and muddy White's reputation at a crucial
moment.
 &HT;    Would Rove really have gone that far for a client? Probably not,
I had thought. But then I rented a movie he recommended, a Sidney
Lumet film, ``Power,'' about the high-flying, low-sinking life of
one really smart political consultant, played by Richard Gere.
 &HT;    ``I thought of myself as the Richard Gere character,'' Rove had
said wryly. ``You gotta rent this, it's so unbelievably stupid.
He's working for this guy who's a total schlump, and of course they
get the schlump elected governor.''
 &HT;    Rove's point, he made clear, was that Hollywood was wrong,
deliciously wrong. Because in real life, he believes, the schlumps
are generally found out. It's not such an unrealistic movie,
really, but I was surprised to watch as Gere's character discovers,
in the heat of a gubernatorial race ... that his office has been
bugged. And as it happens, the movie was released in 1986, the same
year Rove's office was said to have been bugged.
 &HT;    When I asked him about the coincidence, he laughed, then stopped
laughing and kind of cocked his head. Then he said, ``I don't have
any recollection of that.''
 &HT;    The feeling in the Bush camp seems to be that whatever Rove has
done has worked pretty well so far; he is fully in charge and
likely to remain so. Rove's friend Reggie Bashur, who has worked
for Bush in the past, probably summed it up best: ``They're
winning, so it's like that old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't
fix it.'''
