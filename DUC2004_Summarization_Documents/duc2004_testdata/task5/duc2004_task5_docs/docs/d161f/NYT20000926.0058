   AUSTIN, Texas _ While aides to Gov. George W. Bush say there may
be a mole in their midst, Texas Democrats are blaming the
Republican campaign's top dog for leaking sensitive information to
the enemy camp.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how a debate preparation tape and confidential
campaign documents made it into the hands of an aide to Vice
President Al Gore, a mystery now being investigated by the FBI. The
Bush campaign suggested over the weekend that the Gore campaign had
planted a spy at the campaign's headquarters in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Molly Beth Malcolm, Texas Democratic Party chairman,
offered up a different scenario: Karl Rove, Bush's chief political
consultant, manufactured the incident to create a distraction from
a campaign struggling to regain its footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has Karl Rove's fingerprints written all over it,'' said
Malcolm, who offered no proof to back up her contention. She said
it was no coincidence that Rove was at the center of an
eavesdropping controversy in the 1986 Texas governor's race, a
mystery that also drew the attention of the FBI but was never
officially solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``His history is this kind of stuff,'' Malcolm said. ``This
helps get the attention off of the issues of this campaign and
maybe helps Karl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett called the accusation
``silly partisan rhetoric'' aimed at distracting attention from a
Gore aide's suspension after he reportedly bragged that he knew of
a mole in the Bush camp. The aide, Michael Doyne, now says he made
it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the more the FBI investigates, the more nervous
Nashville gets,'' Bartlett said. ``It appears also that Al Gore
will say anything to get elected and the Gore campaign will do
anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett also accused the Justice Department of politicizing the
investigation. He was referring to published reports that the FBI
had identified a suspect within the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The current Justice Department, he said, ``has a history of
playing politics with investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery began on Sept. 13, when Gore confidant Tom Downey, a
former New York congressman, received an Express Mail package
containing a videotape of Bush in a mock debate. Also in the
package was a stack of debate briefing papers.
</P>
<P>
   Downey promptly turned the package over to the FBI, and the tape
caper has been grabbing headlines ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is responsible for the leak, Democrats say it bears an
uncanny resemblance to a bugging case that mysteriously emerged in
the waning days of the 1986 Texas governor's race, a bitter rematch
between Democratic Gov. Mark White and former Gov. Bill Clements,
whom White had ousted four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, there was an alleged security breach at the height
of a very close contest. Then, as now, the chief campaign
consultant to the Republican candidate was Karl Rove. And then, as
now, the FBI got involved.
</P>
<P>
   Something else is strikingly similar, and equally intriguing to
conspiracy theorists: One of the other main characters in the 1986
drama was Mark McKinnon, then an aide to White, now Bush's top
media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In the current mystery, McKinnon and Rove are two of a handful
of senior aides who had copies of the videotape. In 1986, Rove and
McKinnon were on opposite sides of the bugging flap, which occurred
on the eve of a televised debate between White and Clements.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, employing language similar to the phrase Bush officials
now use to tar Gore, blamed the bugging on the White campaign:
``Finding the bug convinced me that the opposition would say
anything and do anything to win an election,'' Rove told The
Washington Post for an article that ran Oct. 7, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, then press secretary to White, bristled at the
suggestion that the campaign of the Democratic governor _ defeated
a few weeks later by his old rival _ was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the Republicans are the ones who have
experience at this kind of stuff,'' he told the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, referring to the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, McKinnon and Rove are again making
headlines together, albeit under markedly different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate tape mystery, Republicans in Washington have
expressed suspicions that McKinnon, who used to work exclusively
for Democrats, might have a Democratic spy on his staff, according
to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon did not return telephone calls placed Monday by the
Star-Telegram, but he said in a Sept. 21 Washington Post article,
``There is no possibility of a mole on my staff.''
</P>
<P>
   While McKinnon and other top officials have been interviewed by
the FBI, Rove had not, as of late Monday, aides said. That alone,
as Time magazine reported, ``started a new torrent of
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, said Rove would be available for
FBI agents ``as soon as they are ready.''
