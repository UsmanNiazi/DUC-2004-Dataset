   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush, a possible
contender for the White House in 2000, is riding about as high as
you can get in politics. Here are some of the people who have
helped put him there:
</P>
<P>
   KARL ROVE (The Guru) _ Rove, 47, is Bush's political director,
top strategist, gatekeeper, fund-raiser and adviser. He worked for
Bush's father in the early 1970s when the future president was
chairman of the Republican National Committee; informally helped
George W. in an unsuccessful 1978 bid for Congress; and was an aide
to Gov. Bill Clements. His firm, Karl Rove &AMP; Co., has served
clients in at least 24 states and one foreign country (socialist
Sweden!). Rove teaches a university class but never graduated.
How's he do that? ``Because I'm good at what I do,'' Rove once
said.
</P>
<P>
   JOE ALLBAUGH (The Enforcer) _ Allbaugh (6-foot-4, 20-inch neck,
crew cut) looks more like a football coach than chief of staff.
He's the guy who keeps the trains running on time. An Okie,
Allbaugh, 47, was deputy secretary of transportation in Oklahoma
and top aide to former Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon.
</P>
<P>
   KAREN HUGHES (The Spokeswoman, also known as Surgeon General of
Spin) _ Much more than a mouthpiece, Hughes, 41, is part of Bush's
inner sanctum of advisers. A former reporter for Dallas-Fort Worth
television station KXAS/Channel 5, Hughes has been known to cut
Bush off at his own news conferences to ensure proper spin. Even
Democrats express grudging admiration for her work, including her
relentless _ and effective _ criticism of Gov. Ann Richards when
Hughes was executive director of the Texas Republican Party
(1992-94).
</P>
<P>
   DON EVANS (The Best Friend) _ Bush and Evans, 52, (''Evvie'' in
Bushspeak) go way back _ to the early days in Midland, Bush's
hometown. Evans is president and chairman of the board of Tom Brown
Inc., a Midland oil firm. He served as campaign manager for Bush's
unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978; he later tapped Bush to
serve on the Tom Brown board. As governor, Bush appointed his
friend to the University of Texas Board of Regents; he remains a
close adviser.
</P>
<P>
   HARRIET MIERS (The Lawyer) _ Miers, 53, was once described by
Bush as a ``pit bull in size 6 shoes.'' The first female president
of a large Texas law firm (Locke Purnell of Dallas), Miers was
selected this year as one of the 50 most influential lawyers in
America by the National Law Journal. She's Bush's personal attorney
and was selected by the governor to be chairwoman of the Texas
Lottery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT HAWKINS (The Numbers Guy) _ A graduate of Fort Worth's
Paschal High School, Hawkins, 45, is director of the governor's
budget office and former assistant director of the Legislative
Budget Board. He's also the top-ranking African-American on Bush's
staff. When Bush needs advice on budget matters, his refrain is,
``Get Albert's opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   VANCE MCMAHAN (The Policy Guy) _ McMahan, 36, oversees policy
and policy research for the governor. He did the same thing for
gubernatorial candidate Bush in 1994. Before hooking up with Bush,
McMahan practiced law in Houston with the firm of Andrews and
Kurth.
