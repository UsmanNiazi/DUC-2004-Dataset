 &HT;    Questions of campaign deception bugging Rove
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stakes were high, and crucial information seemed to be
leaking from the Republican camp to the Democratic camp. The big
debate was upcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Finger-pointing and blame-throwing ensued. Each side implicated
the other. The feds were called in.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1986 Texas gubernatorial race, and key players
involved then are involved now as a similar scenario unfolds. The
FBI is trying to figure out how a tape of GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush's debate preparation wound up in the hands of an
adviser to Democratic nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas Democrats are suggesting _ while reminding reporters
Monday of the earlier event _ the similarities between the latest
flap and the one 14 years ago are more than coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vintage Republican, and I say that as a former
Republican,'' said Texas Democratic Chair Molly Beth Malcolm.
``When Republicans are desperate and they can't get back on message
_ because they don't have a message to begin with _ they try to
find a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The story line is familiar, but key antagonists in the 1986 race
are now allies in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Mark McKinnon was the media guru for Democratic Gov.
Mark White and Karl Rove was the chief strategist for GOP
challenger Bill Clements. As the gubernatorial campaign's only
debate drew near, word got out that a private eye hired by Rove
found an electronic transmitter hidden behind a red, white and blue
elephant needlepoint framed and hung behind Rove's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Aha, said Rove, who hired the private eye after becoming
convinced that campaign inside information was leaking out. The
White campaign denied any involvement and fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the Republicans are the ones who have
experience at this kind of stuff,'' McKinnon said at the time,
referring to Watergate. ``If their goal is to distract the campaign
from the issues, they've done it fully. This thing stinks and the
wind is blowing from over there.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McKinnon is over there, and, as a former
Democratic strategist, he knows he is a natural suspect as
speculation grows about the purloined tape. But Bush campaign
officials say they have no reason to doubt the loyalty of the
trusted, top-level aides, such as McKinnon, who had access to the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon now speaks glowingly about Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, operating on nothing but surmise and her recollections
of 1986, believes McKinnon had it right the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has Karl Rove's fingerprints all over it,'' she said
Monday, convinced that top Bush aides were somehow involved in
making it look like the Gore camp was spying.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators have pointed no finger of blame. In 1986,
the FBI investigation played out to no conclusion. No charges were
ever filed and nobody ever figured out how the bug got behind the
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, during a Senate confirmation hearing when he was
nominated for the East Texas State University regents, Rove noted
that he never blamed the White campaign for the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'll recall, I specifically said at the time that we
disclosed the bugging that we did not know who did it, but we knew
who might benefit from it. And no, I do not know'' who planted the
bug, Rove testified. ``As to who bugged it, senator, I do not know,
and the FBI does not know.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1986 race, Texas politics moved on, leading directly
to the current presidential race. Clements beat White. Four years
later, he did not seek re-election, clearing the way for Democrat
Ann Richards, with McKinnon as a top adviser, to beat Republican
Clayton Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bush ousted Richards. In 1998, Bush, with McKinnon as
his media adviser, won re-election in the race that set him up for
the current presidential bid with former adversaries Rove and
McKinnon as allies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials acknowledge that McKinnon, because of
his Democratic past, quickly pops up as a suspect in the
clandestine tape shipment. But Bush aides, who insist the tape and
related documents were accessible only to trusted, top-level
staffers, do not suspect McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely confident it's not anyone within the Bush
organization,'' a Bush confidante said Monday. ``We've certainly
upgraded our security.''
</P>
<P>
   On the record, officials with both campaigns are complying with
FBI requests to keep quiet about details. Top Bush aides have been
interviewed by federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Gore campaign suspended Michael Doyne, a
28-year-old junior staffer, who had made comments indicating he
knew of a ``mole'' in the Bush campaign office here. Doyne later
recanted the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani said the Democratic
campaign found ``no evidence whatsoever that the campaign has
either received or used confidential information from the Bush
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gore told reporters he did not know who sent the
stolen tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read the reports that the FBI has identified a Bush
campaign official as the person responsible but I have no knowledge
other than that,'' said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Rove on Monday was unavailable for comment. Since 1986, he has
consistently denied self-bugging his office for political gain in
that gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   Some writers have tried to make something of the fact that Rove
likes to recommend the Sidney Lumet film ``Power,'' a tale of a
political consultant who helps get a less-than-qualified man
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which includes a scene in which the political
consultant discovered his office was bugged, was released in 1986.
