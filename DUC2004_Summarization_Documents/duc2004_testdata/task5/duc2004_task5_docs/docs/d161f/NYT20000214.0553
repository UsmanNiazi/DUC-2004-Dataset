BUSH ADVISER, YEARS AGO, HELPED DRAFT A PUSH POLL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has expressed outrage
at the accusation from the McCain camp that his campaign is
involved in the controversial political technique known as push
polling, in which workers posing as pollsters spread negative
charges about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has threatened to fire any campaign staff member involved
with push polls.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996 in Texas, however, Karl Rove, Bush's longtime
political adviser and the chief architect of his presidential
campaign, helped draft a push poll, financed by the tobacco
industry, that was used in an effort to thwart a planned state
lawsuit against the tobacco companies. At the time, Rove was both a
top consultant to Bush and a $3,000-a-month consultant to Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the 1996 push poll was the attorney general of
Texas, Dan Morales, a Democrat. At the time, Morales was preparing
to file a lawsuit against several tobacco companies to seek
reimbursement for billions of dollars that the state had spent on
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Morales, who )s no longer attorney
general, said the pollsters had used negative and false information
about his record in an effort to sway the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the survey shows that it included more than a dozen
negative statements about Morales' record as attorney general.
Morales says the poll distorted his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said that the results, which showed that most Texans
rated a tobacco lawsuit as a low priority, were shared with him by
a Philip Morris lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to use the results of this poll to intimidate me
into not filing the lawsuit,'' Morales said. ``I was not surprised
by the effort. But it was somewhat disconcerting to see the dual
rol% that Rove was playing, as chief Philip Morris lobbyist for
Texas while he was the chief political consultant to the governor
of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Morales filed the lawsuit against the tobacco
companies. And in January 1998, the industry settled the lawsuit
with the state of Texas for $15 billion, a figure that was
eventually increased to $17.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in
fees to the five lawyers and firms for the plaintiffs. Bush took no
position on the merits of the lawsuit, but after the settlement he
called the fees awarded to plaintiffs' attorneys ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said:
``Mr. Rove's role was only to review a fifth draft of a survey that
had been written by someone else and to suggest that a copy be
shared with the attorney general. That was the extent of his
role.''
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition conducted in 1997, Rove acknowledged that he had
offered suggestions about the poll's questions and demographics and
recommended that a copy of the results be provided to Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Rove was a consultant to Philip Morris from 1991 to December
1996. He said he ended his representation of Philip Morris in
December 1996, in part to avoid bringing controversy to Bush. But
from January 1995 to December 1996, the two jobs overlapped.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of push polling erupted in South Carolina last week as
a bitterly divisive issue between the McCain and Bush campaigns. It
began when a distraught woman told Sen. John McCain that her
teen-age son had taken a call from a pollster who portrayed McCain
as a ``cheat and a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush angrily denied that the call came from one of his pollsters
and has released the scripts used by some of them to prove that his
campaign is not spreading falsehoods about McCain. Some Bush
operatives have privately pointed fingers at McCain's advisers for
past client work that involved push polls.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Rove said that after the poll was conducted,
he delivered a copy to Joe Allbaugh, an executive assistant to Bush
and now his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that Allbaugh did not give the document to Bush but
instead ``put it in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco push poll was conducted by Public Opinion
Strategies, an Alexandria, Va., firm. Neil Newhouse, a partner at
the firm, did not return calls Monday.

<P>
   Morales said that in the push poll that Rove helped draft, his
positions on an array of issues, including gun control and
affirmative action, were mischaracterized. And he said respondents
had been influenced by the false information. ``They said
conservative groups rated me as a left-leaning, liberal Democrat,
which is simply not true,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Opinion Strategies summarized its findings this way:
``The lawsuit is opposed by a strong majority of Texans, and they
express skepticism over the motives of the attorney general on the
issue. Dan Morales is in good shape politically, but he has some
areas of softness, and others of outright vulnerability. The lack
of support for the lawsuit _ especially since it is being filed by
private lawyers who stand to gain after contributing to the
attorney general's campaign _ is a clear vulnerability for the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales did not seek re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Public Opinion Strategies has a new client in the 2000 political
race: John McCain.
