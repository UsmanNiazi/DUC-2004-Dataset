COMMON

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ They don't like to talk about each other, but
Karl Rove and John Weaver have more than a few things in common.
</P>
<P>
   They're both Texas political consultants, they're both die-hard
Republicans, and each is at the epicenter of the Republican
nomination battle between Gov. George W. Bush and Sen John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And as the battle heats up going into Saturday's dramatic South
Carolina showdown, the rivalry between Weaver and Rove looms almost
as large as the one shared by the candidates they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, 40, recruited McCain to run for president three years
ago and is now his political director. Rove, 49, has been
dispensing political advice to the Bush family since the 1970s and
is now the governor's chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   There is no love lost between the two, though each declined to
talk about what split up their once warm friendship. But the Lone
Star intrigue behind the scenes of the 2000 race has not gone
unnoticed back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little ironic that in the presidential race in 2000,
the subtext is that these two people emerge again in a Titanic
battle,'' said one veteran Texas GOP campaign aide. ``Karl has
always had the upper hand. We'll see this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning conventional wisdom on its head, Weaver devised a
guerrilla strategy that entailed skipping the expensive Iowa
caucuses and focusing on four early primaries _ New Hampshire,
South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, meanwhile, orchestrated an early ``front porch campaign''
that brought hundreds of supporters to Bush's doorstep in Austin,
asking him to get in the race. The strategy propelled Bush into the
fundraising stratosphere and gave him an early lead in opinion
polls that most experts once considered insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   But when McCain trounced Bush in New Hampshire with 18 points to
spare, Weaver's strategy and the Arizona senator's candidacy _
which Rove and others had only weeks before dismissed _ suddenly
seemed credible.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, in an interview in South Carolina on Friday, said he was
inspired in part by the 1984 campaign of Gary Hart, who gave
Democratic Party favorite Walter Mondale a scare after winning the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kermit, a small outpost between Odessa and El Paso,
Weaver got his start in Republican politics after meeting Phil
Gramm at Texas A&AMP;M University. When Gramm, then a professor, ran
for the U.S. Senate, Weaver became his political director.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his tenure as political director for Gramm's 1996
presidential run that Weaver met McCain and thought he'd make a
good candidate. Three years ago, he pulled McCain out of a
committee hearing in Washington and told him he ought to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw how he connected with voters,'' Weaver said. ``I thought
if there was ever an opportunity for someone to return our party
back to its roots and connect with the American people it would be
the post Clinton era and it would be John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who twice worked for Bush's father, said he likes the
governor and notes that he and his wife both contributed to the
governor's past gubernatorial campaigns. He said the race is not
personal but instead is about ``electing the best president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the Bush campaign's strategy, which Rove
largely devised, Weaver said the governor's team ``certainly raised
a lot of money. That was one thing that they showed they could do
beyond anybody's wildest imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver criticized the campaign's recent use of negative ads:
``They seem to have multiple strategies (since) right after New
Hampshire. They settled on a scorched earth strategy. That's not
surprising. There's nothing more panicked than an establishment
cornered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials say McCain started the negative campaigning, and
dismiss his decision to unilaterally halt his own attack ads as
proof they backfired. For his part, Rove has repeatedly lashed out
at McCain in television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not with him he belittles you, he makes fun of you,
he disparages you,'' Rove told CNN. ``That's not the mark of a
leader who can unite this party and win the White house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, a Colorado native, got his start in politics as a member
of the College Republicans, a national student organization. It was
there that he met Lee Atwater, a South Carolina native who went on
to run President Bush's successful 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming chairman of the GOP college group, Rove was
investigated by the Republican National Committee for allegedly
trying to teach students how to engage in political ``dirty
tricks.'' The committee exonerated him, and Rove went to work for
the RNC chairman _ George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   He has been an adviser to the Bush family ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is a near-mythic fixture in Texas politics. He has been
involved in virtually every successful Republican candidacy since
the late 1970s, and is considered by political activists one of the
chief architects of the modern Texas GOP.
</P>
<P>
   One columnist called Rove ``Bush's brain,'' and the moniker has
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   According to associates, Rove and Weaver first became friends
when the two worked on Gramm's successful 1984 Senate campaign. A
few years later, they became entangled in a billing dispute when
Weaver was head of Vice-President Bush's 1988 presidential campaign
and Rove was a paid Bush consultant, GOP sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Rove became the dominant political consultant in
Texas _ and Weaver his competitor. Against that backdrop, the
stakes are extra high in South Carolina for both Texans. Rove would
not predict victory, saying it's ``going to be a close election,
potentially a long night.'' Polls show the race a statistical dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   For Weaver, no matter what happens, the McCain campaign will be
his last, he said. When it's over, he said he's going to find a
less stressful and time consuming line of work so he can spend more
time with his wife and 7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed a lot of my daughter growing up, and my wife, I
need to be with her more,'' Weaver said. ``It's time to do
something else. This is a young person's business.''
