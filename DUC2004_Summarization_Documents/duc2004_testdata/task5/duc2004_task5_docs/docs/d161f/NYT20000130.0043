 &HT;    Two former friends lead Bush, McCain forces

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ They've been friends and foes and, at one
time, almost business partners. Now, in a subplot to the
presidential race, longtime Texas political strategists Karl Rove
and John Weaver are going head to head for the Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is the chief strategist behind George W. Bush's political
rise to Republican front-runner for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, once a bright young star of Texas GOP politics, is
political director _ No. 2 man in the strategy department _ for
Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican with the best chance of
derailing Bush's (and Rove's) White House dream.
</P>
<P>
   It all could come to a head Tuesday when New Hampshire
Republicans vote. Polls show McCain leading, but a Bush win could
deal a near-fatal blow to McCain's campaign. With it would fall
Weaver's last chance to finally score a big win over former friend
and colleague Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Once, they were the best of friends, working side by side in
Texas' then-emerging Republican Party. Their paths diverged in the
late 1980s _ after a professional and personal falling-out that
neither will talk much about _ leading them to opposite sides of
the country's ultimate Republican contest.
</P>
<P>
   For Rove, 48, the presidential campaign is the logical
progression of a career in which he has helped turn Texas
Republican and glued himself to a political star. For Weaver, 40,
the White House race is a last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last campaign,'' said Weaver, whose wife and
6-year-old daughter are moving to Laconia, N.H., in June. ``I've
been away too much. I've not been a good husband or a good father
by being too involved in campaigns and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver doesn't know what's next, ``but it's not going to be
politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ON A SIMILAR COURSE
</P>
<P>
   Rove and Weaver have walked similar political paths to this
final confrontation. Rove is the most important Texas Republican
whose name has never been on a ballot. He has helped craft the
message and campaigns of most of the GOP candidates who paved the
way for the party's takeover of statewide offices. In 1978, with
Rove on board, Bill Clements won the gubernatorial race and became
the first Republican to hold a statewide executive office since
Reconstruction. In 1998, with Rove's involvement, the GOP completed
its sweep of all 27 statewide posts, which range from governor to
all nine Texas Supreme Court seats.
</P>
<P>
   His success helped force Weaver to look outside Texas for
clients. Weaver built a successful career by signing on with
candidates across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rove and Weaver both came up through the college ranks. Rove got
involved with the College Republicans in 1973. Weaver became active
in politics as a Texas A&AMP;M student in 1978 when Aggie economics
professor Phil Gramm successfully ran for the U.S. House. He helped
Gramm become a U.S. senator in 1984. In 1996, Weaver was field
director for Gramm's ill-fated presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Rove have worked together for many GOP candidates,
including the elder George Bush's successful 1988 White House race
and several contests involving Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a native of Kermit in West Texas, and Rove, a Colorado
native, wound up on opposite sides for the first time in 1986.
Weaver worked in then-U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler's bid for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination. Rove worked for ex-Gov. Clements, who
surprised everyone by deciding he wanted back the job he lost in
1982 to Democrat Mark White. After Clements won the nomination,
Rove brought Weaver on board for the general election campaign,
which ended with Clements exacting his revenge on White.
</P>
<P>
   With Clements' approval, Weaver became executive director of the
Republican Party of Texas in 1987. Though some GOP operatives
recall some testy moments between Weaver and GOP Chairman Fred
Meyer, the ex-chairman says Weaver did a solid job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Weaver was in charge of day-to-day operations of
then-Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign in Texas.
It was in that role that Rove and Weaver had the falling-out that
doomed their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   People involved said a major flashpoint was a disagreement over
whether to use a Bush campaign fund-raising mailing that included a
letter from then-President Ronald Reagan or one from Clements.
Weaver favored the Reagan letter, and believed Rove favored the
Clements one only because Clements was a client. Over Weaver's
strong objections, the Clements letter was sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That started kind of an ongoing argument between them,'' said
a Texas Republican consultant familiar with the chapter in party
history. ``They started out as very good friends, very close
friends. They drifted apart. There was a succession of events in a
short period of time that set them on different courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove and Weaver were both on hand at a Houston hotel for the
elder Bush's victory celebration in 1988, but it was the last time
they were on the same side. Weaver fell into deep disfavor with
Clements, making it difficult for him to get Texas clients.
Clements declined to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a personal falling-out between the two
consultants, but Rove, Weaver and people close to them won't
discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are touching on some raw nerves between a couple of
people,'' said someone who has known both men for many years.
``It's deep, and it's personal, and it's not all pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's post-election plan to team up in an Austin,
Texas-based political consulting firm dissipated. Weaver wound up
as a competitor to Rove in the direct-mail business, the political
niche that made Rove well-known around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver says he is ``indifferent'' to his history with Rove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it one way or the other,'' he said. Asked
if he considers Rove a friend, Weaver said methodically: ``I
consider him another person in this profession who is very
talented, very focused, works very hard and has had a tremendous
track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove is uncharacteristically low-key when asked about Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really not about Weaver or me. It's about the
candidates. I really have had little or no contact with him for 12
years,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT PATHS
</P>
<P>
   Weaver formed Campaign Services Group in 1988. It was based in
Austin until he moved it to San Antonio in 1993. Rove continued
doing his political magic from an office until last year, when he
sold the company and moved into Bush's downtown Austin campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After 1988, the Rove-Weaver rivalry popped up again in the 1993
special election to replace Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who became treasury
secretary for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver signed on with U.S. Rep. Jack Fields of Humble. Rove,
adding to his run of winners, worked with then-state Treasurer Kay
Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Rove continued working for winners in Texas. Weaver worked for
congressional candidates across the country, including Sens. Fred
Thompson of Tennessee and Jeff Sessions of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Weaver took a leave from his firm to work for Gramm's
presidential campaign. He returned to his firm in San Antonio after
that. A year later, he began trying to talk McCain, whom he had met
on several campaigns, into running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laughed me off, thought I had lost my mind, which maybe I
have,'' Weaver said. ``But I stayed all over him like a wet shirt
about running. The country badly needs him.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver sees nothing traitorous in trying to derail Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with being a loyal Texan,'' Weaver said.
``It has everything to do with who you think would make a better
president. I have great respect for George. But I think John McCain
would make a great president on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Austinite John Colyandro, who has worked with Weaver and Rove,
said Weaver has ``a grudging respect for Karl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitors or not, you can't look at his success and not
acknowledge that Karl has done extraordinarily well,'' Colyandro
said. ``The competition, quite candidly, has been one-sided. Karl
has prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver denies that he is driven by the possibility of derailing
Rove's biggest campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about John McCain and the country and the fact that
this country needs someone to change the political system and lead
the nation into the next century,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Rove sees no revenge factor either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what's motivating him,'' Rove said of Weaver.
``What's motivating him is the chance to play in the big leagues.
Being involved in a presidential race is a unique opportunity, and
he has had it twice.''
