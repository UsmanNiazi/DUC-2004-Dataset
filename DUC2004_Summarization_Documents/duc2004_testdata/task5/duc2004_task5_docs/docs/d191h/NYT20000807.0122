   WASHINGTON _ Sixteen years ago, two Vietnam veterans, John F.
Kerry and Al Gore, joined the elite club of the US Senate. They
were a study in contrasts, the Southerner who opposed gun control
and federal funding for abortion, and the New Englander who quickly
became one of the Senate's most liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the two men, both envisioning themselves as
possible future presidents, both well-heeled Ivy Leaguers, watched
each other warily, clashing on some issues, working together on
others.
</P>
<P>
   The clash nearly exploded: Last year, Kerry was uncertain enough
about Gore that he almost challenged the vice president for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond between the two men, woven through common interests
in the environment, technology and foreign affairs, has survived _
and has remained strong enough that Gore put Kerry at or near the
top of his list of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut was ultimately
Gore's choice, the search highlighted the
rivalry-turned-partnership of two ambitious Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 election, a landslide reelection of the Reagan-Bush
ticket, was a disaster for many Democrats. But Gore and Kerry were
among the survivors, and they viewed themselves as the future of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   From neighboring suites on the fourth floor of the Russell
Office Building, the two joined forces on everything from arms
control to veterans' benefits to the emerging world of computers
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an automatic camaraderie there, there was a start of
a friendship that had a lot to do with them being in the same class
where not many Democrats won that year,'' a Kerry associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam linked the two veterans. Gore served as an Army
journalist, reporting the war more than participating in it. Kerry
found himself in the the thick of battle, serving as a highly
decorated Navy officer aboard a gunboat.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, the relationship was ideologically unsure.
Gore, whose father had lost the Senate seat in 1970 after he was
branded as too liberal, struck a much more conservative chord than
is consistent with his current image.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to avoid his father's fate, Gore earned a top rating
from the National Rifle Association and opposed federal funding for
abortion. These positions, said Bill Bradley, his chief primary
opponent, showed Gore's real beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was quite the opposite. He embraced liberalism, as proudly
and defiantly as he once worked with a group called Vietnam
Veterans Against the War.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael S. Dukakis ran for governor in 1982, with Kerry as
running mate for lieutenant governor, some perceived Kerry as the
more liberal of the two. Later, in 1988, Dukakis was tagged as a
liberal, and lost to George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year their Senate arrival, Gore's and Kerry's
directions seemed clear. In 1985, when Congressional Quarterly
tabulated the 14 most important votes, the two senators agreed on
10 but disagreed on four revealing issues. Gore voted for, and
Kerry against, these four measures: spending $1.5 billion to buy 21
mobile MX nuclear missiles; limiting contributions to the United
Nations; relaxing many gun control laws; and further penalizing
employers who had knowingly hired illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings of Gore and Kerry, as compiled by liberal and
conservative groups, reflected those votes: Kerry agreed with the
liberal Americans for Democratic Action 85 percent of the time,
compared with 65 percent for Gore. Gore agreed with the American
Conservative Union 17 percent of the time, compared with 5 percent
for Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who also
arrived in 1984, said Kerry and Gore got along well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you differ doesn't mean you don't have a good
relationship,'' Simon said. ``I had a good relationship with Jesse
Helms, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kerry and Gore, like Simon himself, seemed to view
themselves as presidential material, Simon said. But Kerry and Gore
saw different paths.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Gore arrived in the Senate, he became a cofounder
of a group called the Democratic Leadership Council, which promotes
a moderate ``New Democrat'' agenda. Another cofounder was Bill
Clinton, then governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry did not join at that time, council officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the mid-1990s that Kerry, partly in response to
the changing politics of the time, had changed his mind. Many
factors led to Kerry's decision: the Dukakis defeat in 1988, the
ascension of William F. Weld as governor of Massachusetts, and the
success of the New Democrats Clinton and Gore in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry decided to join the club, and has become one of the most
active members of the Democratic Leadership Council in the last few
years, according to the council president, Al From.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry over the last four or five years has been almost as
active as any other senator,'' From said. ``He has taken the lead
on education policy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kerry has often said he has been misunderstood
as a doctrinaire liberal. He has maintained that while he is on the
left on some issues, his views in many areas defy classification.
Kerry, for example, backed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
reduction bill during the Reagan administration, a position at odds
with that of many liberal groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also opposed his usual allies in organized labor by
backing free-trade deals, and he upset some teachers' groups by
backing charter schools and the implementation of strict graduation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Kerry was a different sort of senator than when he had
arrived. He voted with the American Conservative Union 16 percent
of the time, compared with his 5 percent in 1985 and zero percent
for Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry had become a bona fide New Democrat. And Gore and the rest
of the Democratic Leadership Council crowd noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This liberal label stuff is silly,'' Dukakis said. ``John is a
good, solid liberal Democrat, call him what you will; but he is
also one to say that he doesn't agree with yesterday's liberal
orthodoxy, and I'm not sure I agree with him all the time. It has
nothing to do with moving to the center. I think it's a strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was also evolving, moving away from some of his
conservative positions, becoming a supporter of gun control laws
and of federal funding for abortion, while remaining solidly in New
Democrat territory on issues such as free trade.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the 1992 presidential race, Kerry and Gore had
both changed; they had moved closer ideologically. The relationship
was solidified by their work together on the environment, according
to Marla Romash, a former Gore aide. In June 1992, the two traveled
together to Brazil to attend the Earth Summit and to push for
reductions in global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry and Gore remained at odds on some issues. In 1991, in
one of the most important votes of Gore's career, the Tennessean
voted to support President Bush's request to use force in the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry voted against the resolution. He said he wanted to give
economic sanctions more time to work ``before rushing headlong into
war.''
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Gore's vote helped him secure the vice
presidential spot. Bill Clinton had waffled on whether he would
have voted for the use of force, and the governor of Arkansas was
searching for a running mate with foreign policy experience who had
backed the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's name came up in the initial search for a Gore running
mate, but he was not seriously considered, partly because of his
voting record and his opposition to the Gulf War resolution.
Indeed, Kerry's Gulf War vote has been a sore point with some Gore
aides in the current process.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, when the Clinton-Gore team took office, Kerry
became one of the administration's most consistent supporters. In
1999, for example, Kerry and three other senators voted with the
administration 93 percent of the time, the highest of any members
of the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by late 1999, Kerry was seriously considering challenging
Gore for the presidential nomination. It was partly a political
question: Could Gore survive the country's disdain for Clinton's
misconduct in the Oval Office, and would there ever be a better
opportunity for Kerry to fulfill his ambition to be president?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the impeachment trial and the prospect of fighting
an incumbent vice president for campaign cash and party loyalty put
an end to the idea of challenging Gore. Moreover, ``John couldn't
find the policy rationale to run against him,'' a Kerry associate
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kerry made his decision, a source said, Gore
called him up to ask: How would you have run against me?
</P>
<P>
   The two agreed to meet at the vice president's mansion on the
grounds of the Naval Observatory in March 1999. For two hours, they
hashed out issues. Kerry outlined potential vulnerabilities for
Gore and suggested courses of action. But mostly, it was ``a
wonk-fest,'' said an aide who participated.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the political equivalent of a peace conference, and
the two agreed to work together. Gore and Kerry had never been
intimate friends, but they shared a belief in the need to keep the
White House in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry promised the vice president that he would vigorously
campaign in New Hampshire, where many residents came from
Massachusetts and were familiar with the senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, as former senator Bill Bradley began
mounting a serious challenge to Gore in New Hampshire, Gore
consulted with Kerry on issues such as health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Gore pondered his choice of a running mate, some of
his associates had a nagging worry: While they believed Kerry had
changed from his dyed-in-the-wool liberal days into a New Democrat,
they feared he would be instantly caricatured by Republicans as
Dukakis's liberal lieutenant governor from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It helped explain why some aides were pushing other New
Democrats whose credentials would be less subject to challenge,
such as the eventual choice, Lieberman, or Senator John Edwards of
North Carolina.
