KERRY EYED AS CONTENDER TO BE GORE RUNNING MATE

<P>
   There is no short list, or even a long one _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But multiple sources close to Vice President Al Gore say Senator
John F. Kerry will be a serious contender in the running-mate
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of appealing qualities, and a sense of being
seasoned personally and politically that would be attractive in a
potential running mate,'' said Michael J. Whouley, a senior adviser
to Gore who previously worked for Kerry in Massachusetts during the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry is definitely one of those half-dozen or dozen people
you have to put in the mix,'' said one Democratic official involved
with the Gore campaign. ``He brings a lot to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Whouley and other sources all explain Kerry's appeal by citing
his valorous military service, his 1996 triumph over former
Governor William F. Weld, and his early and active endorsement of
the vice president. He was also considered a loyal No. 2 when he
served as lieutenant governor under Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding not to run for president, Kerry brought his
political consultants _ John Marttila and Natalie Wigotsky _ to the
White House to advise Gore. He also campaigned for Gore in New
Hampshire, Iowa, and New York, speaking to newspaper editorial
boards and knocking on doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is the type of person who really appreciates loyalty and
appreciates someone who not only endorses, but rolls up their
sleeves and backs up that endorsement with hard work,'' said
another source close to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kerry declined to say Thursday whether he would accept
an offer to be Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of the game, it's both premature and
hypothetical,'' he said in an interview. ``I'm proud and flattered
to be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that one of his colleagues, Florida Senator Bob
Graham, had said he would be honored to serve if called upon, Kerry
continued to demur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal kind of thing between you and the
nominee,'' he said. ``I think the nominee ought to be the first to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kerry has been concentrating on Senate business these
days, he's being promoted for a spot on the ticket by Al From, the
president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that tries
to steer the party to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry is one of the people on every list that I've heard
about,'' said From, who frequently mentions Kerry to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   From praises the senator for taking a visible role on education,
an asset, he says, in a running mate. In speeches, Kerry has urged
more flexibility from teachers' unions and others in reforming
education. With Bush trying to claim the education front and move
to the center in the general election, From said, that makes Kerry
an even better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry has shown the ability to beat a good strong Republican
who's tried to run to the center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to a Kerry selection, however, is that
Massachusetts has a Republican governor who would appoint Kerry's
successor. Kerry is up for reelection in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats say they believe their party does not have a
shot at recapturing the Senate majority anyway, and that a
Republican senator from Massachusetts would quickly lose the seat
to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic official close to the Gore campaign said he
expected the vice president to look for someone who will reinforce
Gore's strengths in the same way Gore underscored candidate Bill
Clinton's in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who's proven himself to be a very adept
campaigner with the deconstruction of Bill Weld,'' the official
said, also pointing to Kerry's performance in their numerous
debates.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted, campaign officials insisted that they have not
begun to move forward with picking a running mate. So far, the
campaign has simply asked Warren Christopher, the former Secretary
of State who led the vice presidential selection process in 1992,
to reprise that role in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has one overriding principle that he'll use in moving
forward in this process,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press
secretary. ``That's finding the person who could take over and
handle the job of the presidency if called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane would not say whether Kerry would fit that profile, but
he did call the senator ``very distinguished, one of our leading
Democrats in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Lehane, ``He did a hell of a job campaigning for the
vice president in New Hampshire and other parts of the country.''
