<P>
   BOSTON _ Ending months of soul-searching and speculation,
Senator John F. Kerry Friday took himself out of the running in the
race for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's decision narrows the field of Democratic candidates to
two: Vice President Al Gore, generally viewed as the front-runner,
and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. At this point, the
one-on-one Democratic primary is shaping up as a sedate affair,
though the Rev. Jesse Jackson may yet launch a campaign and enliven
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Political fireworks are likely to be the preserve of the crowded
Republican nomination contest, where there is no virtual incumbent,
like Gore, to unbalance the field.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Friday, Kerry said he felt happy that
he had made his decision, difficult as it was to set aside his
presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart loves the battle, my heart loves these issues, my
heart said go out and fight for these things,'' said Kerry. ``My
head said the day after the announcement I've got to raise an
exhorbitant amount of money and do it all in 10 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also said he was dissuaded by the compressed primary
schedule that would have required him to spend money in five or six
states simultaneously before a single vote was cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's different from the way it's been in any prior
presidential race and that's what makes it very complicated,'' he
said. He also said he feared that the race could become too
personal as he, Gore, and Bradley, who share similar views, sought
to differentiate themselves from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry made his decision at about 1 a.m. Friday, after discussing
the possibilities one last time with his wife, Teresa Heinz, in
their Georgetown home. Heinz, who attended Friday's press
conference, said she was relieved that Kerry had made a decision,
although she tried to stay neutral and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very good,'' said Heinz. ``I thought my duty was to be
as a good friend, as Socratic as possible, ask him all the hard
questions and make a list of the positives, the negatives, the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``And whenever he felt desperate and said, `What should I do?' I
said, `It's your decision,' '' said Heinz, who had previously
expressed some concerns about the arduous process of running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he and Heinz had discussed using their considerable
wealth to pay for his presidential campaign, but decided against
it. ``We both felt it was the wrong thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he returns his attention full time to his Senate duties,
Kerry said he wants to concentrate on education and children's
issues, and hopes to help elect Democrats to office in 2000. He
said he would eventually endorse a candidate for president, but
would not say Friday which candidate he supports.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry did not rule out a future run for president; indeed, he
declined to speak to the issue at all. ``It's too early to talk
about 2004,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry began informing aides, advisers, friends, and colleagues
of his decision Friday morning. His first call was to Gore, and he
also met with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Kerry had stoked the possibility of a presidential
bid, and by January, some close advisers were convinced Kerry was
going to run.
</P>
<P>
   But John Marttila, one of Kerry's closest associates, said Kerry
was torn over the idea for months and never seemed strongly
inclined to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously just never felt right to John,'' Marttila said.
``He never was able to bring himself to the ultimate decision.
There has been an absence of `I'm going to do this' for the past
three or four months. He was not comfortable with the decision to
go, that has been clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Marttila added, ``He was so anguished by it and
wanted to do it so badly there continued to be a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry considered running for president in 1992, said one
associate who helped talk Kerry out of the idea at the time. But
this associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that he
strongly urged Kerry to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This adviser said Kerry was leaning toward running in January,
but then had many discussions with fellow senators that helped
convince him it was all but futile. Then came the impeachment trial
of President Clinton, which delayed Kerry's announcement by a
month. Some Kerry advisers had thought Gore would be hurt by the
trial, but the opposite seemed to have occurred, with Gore's job
approval rating climbing as loyal Democrats rallied around the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry had plenty of enticements to run, even if he had little
chance to win. He could have raised his national profile and gained
national media scrutiny of his ambitions of the issues important to
him. And if Gore bombed as a campaigner, only Bradley's candidacy
would stand in the way of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some of the biggest obstacles to running had been
cleared away. Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat and a 1992
candidate, decided against running partly because _ unlike Kerry _
he was up for reelection in 2000. Kerrey also conducted polls in
Iowa and New Hampshire that found Gore's standing strong among the
activist Democrats whose support is crucial in early caucus and
primary states.
</P>
<P>
   After Kerry heard that his Nebraska colleague had compiled a
300-page document outlining the pros and cons of a race against
Gore, the Massachusetts senator met privately with Kerrey to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Then House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri
dropped out of the race in hopes of becoming speaker, if Democrats
gain control of the House in 2000. If Kerry really wanted to run,
his worries about a crowded field and lack of money had been
greatly eased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear majority of his friends and advisers and staff
recommended and hoped that he would run,'' said a top Kerry aide.
``He was in the end probably more detached and rational than the
people around him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one huge obstacle remaining, and that was Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's advisers drew up several memos arguing that the
electorate was unenthused about Gore and ready for the kind of
dynamic candidate they expected Kerry to be. But one adviser said
Friday that the Kerry team knew the odds against beating Gore were
enormous. The vice president has effectively been running for
president for six years and had locked up the support of most of
the Democratic political and financial hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime Kerry associate said the senator simply was
exhausted from his 1996 Senate reelection race and the resulting
two-year effort to pay off the more than $2 million in debt from
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have the energy in him to go another 19 to 20
months of nonstop campaigning and fund-raising,'' the associate
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Jackson said Kerry's decision will not
affect his own thinking ``very much,'' but he said he was
disappointed that Kerry stayed out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot to offer,'' Jackson said. ``He would have been
very well organized and financed.'' But, the civil rights leader
added: ``I think perhaps Al Gore's strength ran Kerry off the
road.''
