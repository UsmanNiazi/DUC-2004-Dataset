   Senator John F. Kerry's trip to New Hampshire this month will be
an early step in exploring the possibility of a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Kerry said the junior senator, who has
considered traveling to New Hampshire several times in recent
months only to decide the timing wasn't right, has settled on an
Oct. 23 trip that will mix some meeting with activists, fund
raising for New Hampshire Democrats, and guest lecturing on issues
he hopes to make his own if he does run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Tuesday played down his planned journey north to the site
of the first presidential primary, saying the trip was mostly to
help raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going up in response to a number of requests over a long
period of time,'' Kerry said. ``I am going to help raise money for
the Democratic Party in the state and to just get a feel for what
people are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry, who says he will decide whether to run for president
by the early next year, acknowledged he will probably be thinking,
and perhaps talking, presidential politics as part of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going up to listen and to have a dialogue,'' Kerry said.
``It is a way to combine getting a feel for what is on people's
minds and getting a sense of the lay of the land ... and also (part
of) a long-promised process as to how I will sort out whether or
not I might run.''
</P>
<P>
   The source close to Kerry was more succinct: ``This is certainly
his first foray into New Hampshire to test the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's camp, looking at the effect of the victories
then-Governor Michael Dukakis scored in the New Hampshire primary
in 1988 and former US Senator Paul Tsongas logged there in 1992,
believe a strong showing in the Granite State could rocket Kerry
into national prominence if he decides to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said Tuesday that with California having moved its
primary to March 7 _ the same day as the so-called Yankee primary
when most of New England votes _ candidates would have to be ready
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some very good political heads who are taking a look at
the whole process, what kind of funds are necessary,'' Kerry said.
``The nuts and bolts are being analzyed pretty carefully right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   An early California primary is generally expected to benefit
candidates who are well-known, like Vice President Al Gore, or
those who can pour substantial money into the state's media
markets. Because of his wife's wealth, Kerry would clearly fall
into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's tenative schedule calls for him to begin his day in
Portsmouth at a breakfast with Democratic Party activists. The
senator will then venture to Durham, where he will be a guest
lecturer to a combined University of New Hampshire political
science class. There, Kerry will discuss his ideas on education, an
issue he addressed in a June speech that was designed as an
intellectual framework for a possible presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry will then travel to Manchester for at least one event with
political activists and union officials. Kerry also plans
fund-raisers in Concord and Hanover.
