KERRY'S TIME MAY HAVE COME

<P>
   He is cloistered these helpless days at his wife's mountainside
estate mourning the recent death of his father, at the same time
facing what must undoubtedly be one of the longest, tensest
weekends of his life.
</P>
<P>
   At any point over the next few days, the telephone might ring
for Senator John Kerry. Vice President Al Gore might be on the
other end. And Gore might begin that conversation with the words,
``John, I want you as my running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, a career that has been overshadowed by others will
suddenly be thrust into the clear and open light. John Kerry, for
the first time in a long time, will be the junior senator no more.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is growing with each passing hour, such that
Kerry intimates who have surveyed the field of vice presidential
prospects privately say his chances of being selected are better
than 50 percent. It is an analysis deemed modest by many Washington
veterans, who increasingly view Kerry, with his Vietnam medals,
proven campaign skills, and strong Senate record, as the likely
choice. Gore has scheduled an announcement for Tuesday in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, all public proclamations and private whispers had
it down to six possibilities _ Kerry, Senators Evan Bayh of
Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, House minority leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, and
Governor Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Of those candidates, Gephardt and Shaheen have flatly said they
are not interested in the job. Edwards, first elected just a
year-and-a-half ago, is seen as too inexperienced and unknown. And
Bayh is too short of that undefinable political quality of
gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   Smartly, Kerry has sequestered himself. He is making no pleading
telephone calls to mutual strategists and friends. He has
restricted his public appearances so as to not be seen campaigning
for the job. He has avoided cameras like the plague.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a while, but the man whose unflattering moniker was
``Liveshot'' has learned his lessons well, raising the questions:
Do we have a new John Kerry, a better one at that?
</P>
<P>
   The faults of the old one have been well chronicled. He is, by
many accounts, aloof and arguably arrogant, enraging to local
officials who say he only pays them heed every six or so years,
coincidentally right around election time.
</P>
<P>
   He complains more than most politicians of his stature, feels
more slights, even whines to reporters about coverage that he seems
to constantly deem unfair. Even some allies view him as
opportunistic, and in a business in which self-centeredness is the
dominant gene, Kerry is virtually without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus calls Kerry a ``pretty man,'' and indeed, even at 56
years of age, he has the type of face that other men want to
dislike, including me. Yet I can't.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. First off, he's smart _ smart enough to fashion a
prosperous Senate career with a distinct identity in the shadow of
the most influential legislator this state has ever known: Ted
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved steadily toward the middle in his 14 years in the
Senate, providing definition to the oft-sought but ethereal concept
of centrism. In 1992, Kerry highlighted problems with affirmative
action before any Democrat dared speak ill of it. And in 1998, he
denounced the tenure system in public schools, imperiling his
relationship with powerful teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   He is secure enough intellectually to not only withstand
challenges, but also to invite them from a talented group of aides
and advisers. He can be personable, even engaging, obsessed about
such random activities as the Boston restaurant scene and his
fledgling golf game. His long antennae for slights have given him
valuable insights into life's pitfalls and setbacks _ no small
matter for anyone, but especially someone with a Forbes lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has grown and, more importantly, matured. And come
Tuesday, Massachusetts and the nation may see him in a light he's
never been seen in before. His time may well have arrived.
