KERRY CRITICIZES CHENEY'S CONSERVATIVE VOTING RECORD

   WASHINGTON _ Senator John F. Kerry Wednesday sharply criticized
the conservative voting record of GOP vice presidential candidate
Dick Cheney, while acknowledging he remains under consideration to
be Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those watching as well as participating'' in Gore's
search, Kerry said, but he refused to discuss any conversation he
had with Gore during a $250,000 Democratic fund-raiser the night
before at the senator's Georgetown home.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill news conference on Internet privacy
legislation, Kerry condemned Cheney's congressional votes against
Head Start funding, the Clean Water Act, and a resolution calling
for the release of Nelson Mandela. ``I think what George Bush has
done is help define the race, and in that way it may be very
helpful to the country in the end,'' Kerry said, referring to the
GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism earned Kerry an instant rebuke from Senator John
McCain, the Arizona Republican who had joined Kerry at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered Kerry a near-endorsement and tribute as one of
``the best Americans in both parties,'' but when Kerry criticized
Cheney, McCain complained: ``Any voting record can be selectively
described ... That happened to me in the primary campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry refused to relent, adding, ``I think you have to examine
overall thought, and that's the health of a good debate.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted McCain to break off the mini-debate by quipping,
``To be continued on `Crossfire.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is continued buzz that Gore's short list includes Kerry,
Senators Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Dick Durbin
of Illinois, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Tom Harkin of
Iowa, as well as former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to announce his choice Aug. 8 or 9, less than a
week before the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Gore
spokesman Mark Fabiani mocked any handicapping of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in the Gore campaign not named Al Gore or Warren
Christopher who tells you they know what's going on, they're
basically trying to impress you without knowing what's going on,''
said Fabiani, referring to the former secretary of state heading
Gore's search.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry joked about the speculation Tuesday night before about 50
donors who paid $5,000 each to join Gore at a Democratic National
Committee fund-raiser held at the federalist mansion the senator
shares with his wife, Teresa Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that a number of you have come up to me
tonight and asked me if I have any interest at all in serving as
vice president with Al Gore. Actually, none of you asked me that,
and I'm a bit ticked off,'' he said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   He then introduced Gore with a sharp attack on Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two words that I think will brighten your eyes for the
next several months: Dick Cheney,'' Kerry said. ``I mean, he really
makes the words `compassionate conservative' as difficult to utter
as `Red Sox' and `World Series.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, McCain was asked about the
prospect of Kerry's being chosen for vice president. McCain
replied: ``I think it would be very helpful to Vice President Gore.
I think Senator Kerry has proven his service to our nation and his
ability as an accomplished debater. He personally knows the issues
and, therefore, I strongly recommend that Vice President Gore not
select Senator Kerry as his running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the resulting laughter, McCain added, ``I think that the
best Americans in both parties should be the nominees; I would
certainly put Senator Kerry in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry was asked about Cheney, he alluded to the ``I knew
John Kennedy'' put-down by Democrat Lloyd Bentsen during a 1988
vice presidential debate with Republican Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served with Dick Cheney in Congress,'' Kerry said. ``I knew
him as a secretary of defense, obviously, so I know Dick Cheney,
and Dick Cheney is a friend of mine, and Dick Cheney is no John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator added that Cheney's voting record ``reflects a
thought process'' worthy of debate. It was then that McCain
delivered his rebuke.
