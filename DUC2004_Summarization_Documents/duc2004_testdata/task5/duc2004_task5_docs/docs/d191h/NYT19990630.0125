KERRY'S BIG LEAP FORWARD

<P>
   If they gave a sort of SAT test to grade US senators on what
they know about issues, John Kerry might lead the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute interview at the Globe on Monday, the junior
senator churned through two-dozen subjects with sure-footed ease.
The old Kerry _ cautious, tentative, carefully couched _ has given
way to a more confident and combative Kerry. Like Teddy, he's
effectively senator for life, or as long as he wants to be, and is
free to use the driver off the tee on any hole, no matter how
narrow the political fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the perfidy, the callow crassness, of the
vote in the House on Kosovo,'' he said of the Republican
leadership-fueled 213-213 vote, which to Kerry, to me, and to
millions of others was a despicable political move to undercut US
servicemen by making it ``Clinton's war.'' Added Kerry: ``I think
that was a disgrace.'' While, of course, there were honorable
people opposed to the war, ``too many people were trying to dump
this on Clinton,'' and the withholding of congressional approval of
the NATO bombing campaign after its inception was contrary ``to the
best interests of the country,'' argues the decorated Vietnam
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring as he does in the mammoth shadow of Kennedy Mountain,
the 36-year career of Edward M. Kennedy, Kerry's workaday life has
evolved into picking and choosing his spots. Kennedy's high-energy
staff and nearly four decades of service make Teddy's office the
first port of call for those trying to get the federal bureaucracy
to start or stop something.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, technology, and education, Kerry is making
substantive moves and is now secure enough to admit that he needs
more exposure to complex developments in such quick-changing worlds
as the Internet, where developments unfold at warp speed. Thanks to
a first-rate education (St. Paul's, Yale, BC Law) and a relentless
ambition backed up by a combative and skillful political talent,
Kerry climbed the greasy pole of Massachusetts politics to the
second-highest perch.
</P>
<P>
   He is not your basic warm and cuddly politician. His coolness
can approach frost with great rapidity, and his fellow pols do not
cut him the kind of slack allotted to more demonstrative
personalities. But there are none in the political game who do not
have a high regard for his acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was an effective prosecutor in Middlesex County, a clever
politician as lieutenant governor, and when the Democrats were in
the majority, a highly effective investigator as chair of the
Senate subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism, subjects on which
he has written a respectable book.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current Senate he has no chairmanship, and the
prospects for Democrats regaining control in the next election are
not promising. Should lightning strike and Kerry get chosen, say,
as running mate to Al Gore, the Kerry record would be spread upon
the nation's spotty attention span.
</P>
<P>
   And a pretty good record it is. What surprised me as Kerry
fielded questions is how far up the Senate seniority ladder he's
already climbed. ``I'm 30th in seniority today, and I'll be 28th in
seniority next session, maybe 27th.'' Of course, with Teddy sitting
there at third in seniority (West Virginia's Bobby Byrd and South
Carolina's Strom Thurmond sit astride the Geezer Gallery), Kerry is
still well down the list. But he knows his onions, Senatewise. As
former governor William Weld discovered in their marathon skein of
televised debates (nine of them), Kerry's debating skills are not
to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is learning the telecommunications business to discern the
appropriate role in regulating that pig pile. He's friendly with
Senator John McCain and respects the Arizona Republican's efforts
at campaign finance reform. Democrats, Kerry says, lost four or
five seats in the last two weeks of the 1998 campaign ``to money
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not starry-eyed about the Clinton administration's
sincerity in trying to salvage Medicaid and Social Security
compromises. He admits that ``the health care delivery system is in
chaos'' and needs a big fix. He suspects that his party won't
reclaim the Senate until after Democrats recapture the US House
(where a net gain of six would do the trick).
</P>
<P>
   Kerry opposes labor's protectionist proclivities but concedes:
``If the economy went down here, you'll have an instinctive
reaction in Congress toward protectionism.'' He sees the Internet
as a paradigm shift in the era's economics. ``My bet is we are on
an incredibly new economic curve _ and how do we tame the economic
impact of it?'' That spurs his emphasis on education as the gateway
to work force prosperity. He's for Gore for president, and would
not spurn, one suspects, an invitation to be Gore's running mate.
Al could do worse.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore decides he needs a bemedaled Northerner who can rattle
off speeches on complicated issues, debate with the best of them,
maintain cordial if not cozy relationships with union bigwigs, and
come to the party with no scandal or loose financial ends, Kerry
might have a shot at the big time.
