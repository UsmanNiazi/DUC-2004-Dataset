<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the time they served together in the Senate,
Bob Graham and John Kerry _ both on the short list of Democratic
vice-presidential candidates _ had voting records very similar to
Al Gore's on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the three men were perceived differently by groups rating
their votes, and they differed in the degree to which they adhered
to the party line on issues that divided Democrats from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators reportedly being considered are Richard Durbin of
Illinois and Evan Bayh of Indiana. Both were elected after Gore
left the Senate. Also under consideration is House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt of Missouri. His votes were not analyzed because the
House motions were not identical to those in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, of Florida, was elected to the Senate in 1986, and
Kerry, of Massachusetts, was elected in 1984, as was Gore. The
three served together until Gore was elected vice president in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of key votes, as identified by the Almanac of
American Politics, shows that of the 29 votes in which Gore, Graham
and Kerry all participated, they agreed on 20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues were: raising the minimum wage; the Supreme
Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; the 1990
Civil Rights Act related to job discrimination; limits on death row
appeals, and a ``gag rule'' to prohibit federally financed clinics
from counseling pregnant women about abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Graham differed with Gore and Kerry on six issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. Graham voted yes; Gore
and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Military aid to the government of El Salvador. Graham voted
yes; Gore and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the share of income that elderly must pay for
federally subsidized rental housing. Graham voted no; Gore and
Kerry voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tabling an amendment limiting money for the Strategic Defense
Initiative in 1987. A yes vote supported SDI; a no vote opposed it.
Graham voted yes; Gore and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing benefits to miners who lost jobs because of new acid
rain controls. Graham voted no; Gore and Kerry voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adopting a constitutional amendment banning physical
desecration of the American flag. Graham voted yes; Gore and Kerry
voted no.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry differed with Gore and Graham on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tabling an amendment cutting money for SDI in 1989. A yes vote
supported SDI; a no vote opposed it. Kerry voted no; Graham and
Gore voted yes. The positions taken by Kerry and Graham were the
same as they took two years earlier. Gore's position changed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canceling money for two additional B-2 bombers. Kerry voted
yes; Graham and Gore voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorizing the involvement of American troops in the Persian
Gulf war. Kerry voted no; Graham and Gore voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Kerry did not agree on any key issue on which they
both disagreed with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In their rankings by leading liberal and conservative groups,
Kerry was the most liberal of the three, Graham the most
conservative, and Gore was in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action said
Kerry supported its issues 85 percent to 100 percent of the time
between 1987 and 1992. Graham's ADA scores ranged from 50 percent
to 75 percent, while Gore's scores ranged from 55 percent to 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The American Conservative Union, meanwhile, said Graham's
support ranged from 15 percent to 36 percent. Kerry's ACU scores
ranged from 0 percent to 11 percent, while Gore scored between 6
percent and 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Graham tended to be more of a maverick on issues that pitted a
majority of Democratic senators against a majority of Republican
senators.
</P>
<P>
   According to annual analyses by the independent magazine
Congressional Quarterly, Graham's support on party unity issues
ranged from 68 percent to 84 percent. Kerry's support ranged from
85 percent to 96 percent, while Gore's ranged from 79 to 95
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those votes will shape Gore's thinking in choosing a
running mate is a matter of conjecture. Analysts said the votes
show strong philosophical compatibility between Gore and either
Graham or Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings also highlight the symbolism attached to Gore's
choice of running mates. Does he need more help solidifying his
Democratic base, or should he make a serious effort to win Florida
and its 25 electoral votes?
</P>
<P>
   While analysts agree that the selection of a vice presidential
candidate is unlikely to sway a sizable number of voters, it does
send a message to those who are politically astute and may affect
some voters on the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution, and Norman Ornstein
of the American Enterprise Institute, both non-partisan
Washington-based research centers, agreed that if Gore wants to
solidify his base and appeal to Democrats who may be considering a
vote for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, his choice would be
Kerry over Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Graham is not going to help him mobilize the Democratic
base in the Midwest,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Picking Graham would signify that Gore wants to continue
pursuing ``new Democrats,'' moderates, upscale swing voters and
seniors, Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein suggested that picking Graham ``would send a signal
that a Gore administration, in many ways like the Clinton-Gore
administration, is going to be very much in the center.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a lingering _ though minor _ impact to Graham from
the case of Elian Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   While Graham and Gore both suggested a family court should
decide whether the young Cuban boy should have been allowed to
return to Cuba with his father, Graham was far more outspoken in
his criticism of the administration's handling of the raid that
took the boy from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said Gore's differences with Clinton over the issue ``was
one of his non-shining moments'' whose memory ``some Democrats
would prefer go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein suggested that although Graham and Gore differed in the
intensity of their objections to the Elian case, ``that issue is
past. That's not going to make a difference.''
