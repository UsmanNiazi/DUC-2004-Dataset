<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brimming with indignation, Senator John F. Kerry
this week clamored on the Senate floor for an end to ``soft
money,'' warning that the large, unregulated contributions are
poisoning the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where it comes from?'' Kerry asked Tuesday,
standing at his mahogany desk in the Senate chamber. ``It comes
from U.S. senators who are passing legislation, making telephone
calls or having meetings with high-powered corporate types or very
rich people who write checks for $50,000, $100,000, $250,000 and
$300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And just because Democrats sometimes have exploited the
``soft-money'' loophole in federal election laws better than
Republicans, Kerry said, ``It doesn't make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Kerry is scheduled to host a private
fund-raiser at his townhouse in Washington's Georgetown section
that is expected to generate $250,000 for the Democratic Party _ in
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   As he planned to fuel the multimillion-dollar, soft-money
machine he has railed against, Kerry Wednesday drew scorn from his
Republican foes and varied measures of support from his allies in
the stymied effort to revamp the nation's campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's fund-raiser, highlighted by an appearance by President
Clinton, comes two days after Senate Republicans killed two
campaign-finance measures that Kerry supported, both of which
called for banning soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Senator Kerry was truly committed to ridding the system of
soft money, he would cancel his fund-raiser,'' said state
Representative Brian Cresta of Wakefield, chairman of the state
Republican Party. ``It's another proof that he is the do-as-I-say
senator and not the do-as-I-do senator, and he just can't be
trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who developed a formidable fund-raising network as a
former chief of the Senate Democratic election effort, is an
honorary chairman of the Democratic National Committee's elite
Leadership 2000 group of donors who have pledged to raise $350,000
in soft money for the fight to hold the White House and gain power
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, David Wade, defended Kerry's pursuit of soft
money while trying to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, under the current system, Democrats have to
fund-raise just to remain competitive, and we simply cannot disarm
unilaterally,'' Wade said. ``Throughout his public life, John Kerry
has tried to reform the campaign finance system, and he thinks it's
time right now to elect Democrats to Congress who are going to pass
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   A short motorcade ride from Kerry's event, Clinton also will
attend a fund-raiser Wednesday night at Senator Edward M. Kennedy's
Washington home near Embassy Row. Kennedy expects 350 guests to
contribute about $400,000 for his reelection campaign, none of it
in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law limits the amount individuals may
contribute to a specific candidate to $2,000 per election cycle.
But there are no caps on soft-money donations to political parties
from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's fund-raiser will be more intimate than Kennedy's, with
about 25 donors from the high-tech industry each contributing at
least $10,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both poliical parties are scrambling to cash in on the
burgeoning wealth among leaders of the high-tech industry. The soft
money he hopes to raise is expected to be earmarked for party
building endeavors such as voter registration drives.
</P>
<P>
   Although some election watchdog groups questioned the timing of
Kerry's soft-money fund-raiser so soon after the Senate showdown on
campaign finance, advocates for overhauling the system generally
expressed support for Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money is bad,'' said David Donnelly, executive director
of Massachusetts Voters for Clean Elections. ``But reform groups
measure senators and representatives on their support of campaign
finance reform, and Senator Kerry is about as good as they get.
Unfortunately, he has to play in this system, but it's the only
system we've got.''
