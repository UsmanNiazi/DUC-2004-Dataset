<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retired Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who inspired the
wrath and incited the rage of a generation of abortion foes, was
also a feminist hero.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely hero, this slight, quiet judge from Minnesota died
Thursday at the age of 90. With conservative credentials and
President Nixon's endorsement, he changed the course of the
American feminist movement by writing the 1973 Supreme Court's
decision affirming the privacy rights of women and allowing them
access to legal abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark, 7-2 ruling in the Roe v. Wade case went beyond
giving women control of their reproduction and igniting the most
virulent and polarizing social policy debate of the last 25 years.
It said that women had choices, and they were guaranteed for the
first time by the highest court in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, reactions to Blackmun's death were as sweeping and
sharp as the opinion the justice once rightly predicted he would
``carry to my grave.'' Blackmun retired in 1994 after 24 years on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying for his soul,'' said Judy Brown, president of
the American Life League, an antiabortion group. ``The decision he
wrote has destroyed the lives of millions of children and wrought
havoc on the spiritual well-being of so many women.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for all women. ``Justice Harry Blackmun was my hero,''
said Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, a legal advocacy group in New York. ``Given the chance
to change basic principles of the law, he not only rose to the
occasion, but persevered with increasing force over the years in
his opinions on the importance of women's privacy, equality, and
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process,'' Benshoof added, ``he changed both himself
and the flow of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Former US District Judge Robert Bork, a harsh critic, agrees
there was a transformation: Blackmun changed from a traditional
judge to the most liberal member of the court, and he had an
emormous impact by imposing his own morality on society and
``making up constitutional law out of whole cloth,'' Bork said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe v. Wade was probably the worst Supreme Court decision of
this century,'' said Bork, whose nomination to the Surpreme Court
was rejected by the Senate in 1987. ``If you read his opinion,
which I don't advise, there is not one iota of legal reasoning in
it. He just suddenly says, `there is a right to privacy!' and
that's it _ pure judicial fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun had spent his early career as a lawyer for the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota, and analysts say he approached abortion in the
Roe case with a larger concern for doctor-patient privacy than for
a women's right to choose. It was only after the decision created a
national firestorm of sometimes violent protest, an unending and
emotional political debate, and dozens of legal challenges that
Blackmun became a fierce and brave protector of abortion and
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shift to the left was entirely related to Roe v. Wade and
the intense, uncompromising criticism it provoked,'' said John
Jeffries, a Supreme Court scholar at the University of Virginia Law
School. ``He saw the hint, the shadow of a threat to Roe, and he
felt an enormous responsibility for it. It was almost like a parent
protecting a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, an unassuming man, took the energy and diligence he
applied to every task to defending Roe. On the bench, he fought a
losing battle to guarantee federal funds for abortions, but he
never lost the larger legal challenges aimed at reversing the
fundamental right to an abortion set out in Roe.
</P>
<P>
   Off the bench, Blackmun was dogged by antiabortion protesters
and flooded with hate mail. He made a point of reading much of it,
and said he was ``anguished'' by the issue and took the concerns of
his opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience intensified the once-conservative jurist's
passion for civil rights and social justice. In 1986 he dissented
from the court majority that upheld Georgia's anti-gay sodomy law.
He defended affirmative action in education in the 1978 Bakke case.
He joined the majority in ending discrimination against women
serving on juries. And he wrote the majority opinion in a 1991 case
that stopped employers from discriminating against women workers of
child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Blackmun became an opponent of the death
penalty, calling it a possible violation of the equal protection
clause of the Constitution. In a 1993 interview with National
Public Radio, Blackmun said, ``I don't like the death penalty. I
cringe every time we get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kathryn Kolbert represented Planned Parenthood, the
reproductive rights organization, in two Supreme Court challenges
to Roe. Blackmun's legacy, she said, was in pushing the court
beyond privacy to see that the right to an abortion was a civil
rights issue, since it made women more equal to men in their
economic and social lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackmun helped define in the law that women could enter the
world of work and men could enter the world of family,'' said
Kolbert, who is now a senior researcher at the Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Roe, the other force shaping Blackmun was his personal
life as a husband and a father to three daughters. He often
referred to them in his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he died with the knowledge that while there was
certainly vigorous and heartfelt dissent to the Roe decision,
Blackmun was responsible for saving countless women's lives, and
the majority of the country has been in support of the basic
principles of Roe v. Wade,'' said Marcia Greenberger, co-president
of the National Women's Law Center, a private advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   True to the abortion debate, the National Right to Life
Committee vehemently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe established the current radical abortion policy that
allows abortion on demand as a method of birth control,'' said
David O'Steen, the antiabortion group's executive director. ``It is
a tragedy for someone to go to his grave best remembered for
denying unborn children the most basic civil liberty _ the right to
life.''
