<HEADLINE>  Late Justice Blackmun Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry A. Blackmun was eulogized Tuesday as a  
man with a ``conscientious, humane judicial vision'' who sought to 
understand the people whose lives his Supreme Court opinions would 
affect. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno and humorist  
Garrison Keillor joined Blackmun's family, friends and Supreme 
Court colleagues at a memorial service for the retired justice who 
died last Thursday at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who succeeded Blackmun on the  
nation's highest court in 1994, said he ``made a direct, conscious 
effort to reach out and understand those whose life experience was 
different from his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His accomplishments during 24 years on the court ``reveal a  
vision, a conscientious, humane judicial vision, which he applied 
in one area of the law after another,'' including equal protection 
of the sexes and races, Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun got tens of thousands of letters after he authored the  
1973 Roe vs. Wade opinion that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	One very long letter urged Blackmun to resign, Breyer said, and  
the justice's reply was succinct: ``Dear Sir, No. Sincerely, Harry 
A. Blackmun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Koh, a former Blackmun law clerk and now assistant  
secretary of state, called him ``the people's justice'' who 
``through quiet courage and sheer hard work became the conscience 
of our court in the late 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former law clerk Pamela Karlan told of the time Blackmun, a  
Methodist, came to her Passover seder wearing a yarmulke and having 
studied up on the Jewish rituals. ``He was amazingly open to new 
experiences,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter, Nancy Blackmun, said his long hours at work  
limited his time with his family, but added that for his three 
daughters, ``his were the most comforting hands to hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor led the congregation in the  
Yale University ``Whiffenpoof Song,'' a song about lost lambs that 
Ms. Blackmun said her father often sang to his children when they 
were small, even though he earned his undergraduate and law degrees 
at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William A. Holmes of the Metropolitan Memorial United  
Methodist Church said Blackmun brought to religion and the law ``a 
creative fidelity marked by humility, and always with a twinkle in 
his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton sat on the front row with Blackmun's family. Across  
the aisle were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, seven of the 
eight associate justices, and retired Justice Byron R. White -- the 
only living retired justice. Justice Antonin Scalia was out of town 
due to an illness in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the Supreme Court building, a bouquet of flowers and a  
framed photograph of Blackmun adorned the table in the public 
cafeteria where he regularly had breakfast with his law clerks.
