   ``Poor Joshua! Victim of repeated attacks by an irresponsible,
bullying, cowardly, and intemperate father, and abandoned by
respondents ((Winnebago County Department of Social Services,
Wisconsin)) who placed him in a dangerous predicament and who knew
or learned what was going on, and yet did essentially nothing
except ... `dutifully recorded these incidents in files.' It is a
sad commentary on American life, and constitutional principles ...
that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the
remainder of his life profoundly retarded ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Joshua and his mother, as petitioners here, deserve -- but now
are denied by this court -- the opportunity to have the facts of
their case considered in light of constitutional protection ....''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry A.
Blackmun in dissent in DeShaney vs. Winnebago (1989). They indicate
the depth of Blackmun's concern for the people who live with the
interpretations of the Constitution handed down by this nation's
highest court: ``Poor Joshua!''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his father's beating, half of Joshua's brain was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was left permanently paralyzed and severely retarded.
His mother sued, charging the social services department with
depriving her son of his life and liberty under the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sullivan, Cheyenne, Wyo., attorney and former state
legislator, argued this case at the high court. In an interview
Friday, he said: ``I was disappointed at the outcome. I felt like
the lawyer who argued Plessy vs. Ferguson must have felt. The court
wasn't ready to handle the moral questions in the case. But
Blackmun understood that the law has consequences. I could tell by
his questions that he was favorably disposed to our position.'' (In
Plessy vs. Ferguson, 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
Louisiana law that prohibited people of color from sitting in the
same railroad cars with whites.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Blackmun joined the high court, he wrote a
dissent to the majority opinion in Furman vs. Georgia (1972) which
nullified all death sentences in the United States until the states
adopted fair and consistent guidelines for imposing capital
punishment. He thought the court had overstepped its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Feb. 22, 1994, the year Blackmun would retire from the
high court, he issued a remarkable 22-page dissent when the high
court refused to hear an appeal from a death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and angry at his colleagues on the court for
streamlining the death penalty and limiting the high court's
judicial oversight to executions by the states, he wrote: ``From
this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of
death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored, indeed, I have
struggled along with the majority of this court, to develop
procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere
appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than continue to coddle the court's delusion that the
desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for
regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated
simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. ...
The path the court has chosen lessens us all. I dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun is revered or hated as the author of Roe vs. Wade
(1973), a 7-2 decision which struck down abortion laws because they
violate a woman's right to privacy. Warren Berger, then chief
justice, presumably picked Blackmun to write the majority opinion
because Blackmun had been an attorney representing the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn. Blackmun was the junior member of the court.
And his vote in conference to strike down the Texas and Georgia
abortion laws was flimsy, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Blackmun circulated his first draft opinion to the
court which sought to strike down the abortion laws as
unconstitutionally vague. Justice Byron White responded with a
three-page devastating criticism of Blackmun's vagueness argument.
Had the vagueness argument become the Roe vs. Wade decision, it
would not have become what Blackmun later called ``a landmark in
the progress of the emancipation of women.''
</P>
<P>
   As the end of the term approached, Blackmun still hadn't
completed his revised draft. Two new associate justices were
appointed to fill the seven member court: William Rehnquist and
Lewis Powell. Chief Justice Burger asked for reargument before the
full court, hoping to have enough votes to uphold the abortion
laws. The high court heard oral argument again. And this time
Blackmun's draft opinion was stronger and hinged on the right of
privacy to confirm a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
Even Burger concurred with the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peck, legal director for the Association of Trial Lawyers
of America, was a judicial fellow at the U.S. Supreme Court when
Blackmun was still an associate justice. He recalls that Blackmun
was one of the hardest working justices who wrote his own opinions
and did his own research and often worked late into the night.
``Blackmun,'' he said ``also enjoyed telling stories to people. It
showed his puckish nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck offers this insight: ``Blackmun was a diligent, careful
researcher. He found his voice gradually. He didn't have it in the
early years on the court. In his later years, he was much more
personal in his writings and allowed his emotions to be expressed
in decisions he wrote. He grew more suspicious of government power
and more supportive of individual rights. He was not a liberal in
the Black-Warren tradition, Blackmun became more liberal in a
conservative way.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck noted that Blackmun retained a humility while a justice on
the nation's highest court. He called himself ``Old No. 3'' because
he was President Nixon's third choice to serve on the court after
the defeated nominations of judges Clement Haynsworth and G.
Harrold Carswell.
</P>
<P>
   Carswell had such a poor record as a federal judge _ having one
of the highest reversal rates as a district judge _ that former
Sen. Roman Hruska, R-Neb., who led the fight for Carswell's
nomination, said of him that even the mediocre are ``entitled to a
little representation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Blackmun retired from the high court in 1994, the people
lost an ardent advocate. He understood, as he stated on
``Nightline'' in 1993, that ``behind every case are some individual
people.'' He died last Thursday at the age of 90. And now we mourn
his passing. The court sorely needs a people's justice as a member;
the people need someone on the court who understands how its
decisions impact our lives.
