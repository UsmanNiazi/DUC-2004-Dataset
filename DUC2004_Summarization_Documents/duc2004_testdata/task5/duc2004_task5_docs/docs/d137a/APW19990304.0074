<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Justice Blackmun Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun, who wrote the 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
nationwide and ignited a still-raging moral and political debate, 
died Thursday at 90. 
</P>
<P>
	He had retired in 1994, after serving 24 years on the nation's  
highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died at a hospital in suburban Arlington, Va., from  
complications following hip-replacement surgery performed nine days 
earlier. He had fallen and broken his hip at home a day before the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who had come to know Blackmun well, praised  
him as someone with ``passion for the welfare of the American 
people, for defending our liberties and our institutions, for 
moving us forward together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Blackmun served ``with compassion, distinction and  
honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed in 1970 by President Nixon, Blackmun was considered a  
staunch conservative in his early days on the court. But by the 
time he retired, he was considered its most liberal justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia, who opposed Blackmun's views on abortion  
and many other subjects, called him ``a good man and a good justice 
deserving of the respect of all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who replaced Blackmun, cited his  
``continuous concern for ordinary citizens and for the law's impact 
upon their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun often cast liberal votes in cases pitting individual  
liberties against governmental authority. But he generally voted 
against expanding the rights of criminal suspects. He was a 
champion of maintaining a strict separation between church and 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	But towering above all else in Blackmun's tenure was his role in  
the 1973 decision and subsequent abortion rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	His authorship of Roe vs. Wade brought him repeated threats on  
his life. He received more than 60,000 pieces of ``hate mail'' 
calling him a murderer and comparing him to the Nazi overseers of 
genocide. Blackmun insisted on reading all such mail. ``I want to 
know what the people who wrote are thinking,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1983 interview with The Associated Press on the eve of the  
decision's 10-year anniversary, Blackmun repeated the phrase 
``author of the abortion decision'' slowly and softly. ``We all 
pick up tabs,'' he said. ``I'll carry this one to my grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of stopping just short of reversing Roe vs. Wade,  
the court in 1992 reaffirmed, by a 5-4 vote, the 1973 ruling's 
central holding -- that women have a constitutional right to end 
their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun wrote that the victory was good law only as long as the  
current court was intact. But President Clinton's election and 
Justice Byron R. White's decision to retire before Blackmun 
lessened the anticipated impact Blackmun's departure might have. 
</P>
<P>
	When appointing Blackmun, Nixon called him a ``strict  
constructionist,'' defined by Nixon aides as a judge who leaned 
toward interpreting existing law rather than making new law. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was Nixon's third choice to fill the vacancy created  
when Justice Abe Fortas resigned under fire for having accepted a 
$20,000 fee from the family of a financier who went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected Nixon's nominations of two federal appeals  
court judges, Clement Haynsworth of Greenville, S.C., and G. 
Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, who had been a member of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals since 1959 and was confirmed by a unanimous Senate vote, 
said years later that his No. 3 status ``always kept me a little on 
the humble side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his early years on the high court, Blackmun was derided for  
what legal scholars perceived as his dependence on fellow 
Minnesotan and longtime friend Warren E. Burger, the chief justice 
who had been appointed by Nixon a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was called ``Hip Pocket Harry'' and ``The Minnesota  
Twin'' in print. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end of his first decade on the court, Blackmun had  
established himself as an independent force whose vote often was a 
critical one in close cases. 
</P>
<P>
	He also emerged in a new role -- the justice most intent on  
forcing the court to come to grips with the realities of the 
problems it was asked to resolve and with the real-world effects of 
those resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinions often portrayed those realities with passionate  
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	When the court in 1993 ruled that U.S. authorities need not give  
hearings before seizing and returning Haitians who had fled their 
homeland by boats, Blackmun was the lone dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They demand only that the United States, land of refugees and  
guardian of freedom, cease forcibly driving them back to detention, 
abuse and death,'' he wrote. ``That is a modest plea. ... We should 
not close our ears to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months before his retirement, Blackmun repudiated his  
career-long acceptance of capital punishment and declared himself 
opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death-penalty experiment has failed. I no longer shall  
tinker with the machinery of death,'' Blackmun wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was born in Nashville, Ill., but was raised in St. Paul  
and Minneapolis. He and Burger first met as kindergarten pupils, 
and Blackmun served as best man in Burger's 1933 wedding. But on 
the high court, differences between the two jurists strained those 
boyhood ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun is survived by his wife, Dorothy, three daughters and  
five grandchildren.
