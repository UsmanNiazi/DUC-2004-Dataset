	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun took a  
hard job at 61, when many people think about retiring, and kept at 
it for 24 years with compassion, good humor and a scientist's 
curiosity, his successor on the highest court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun helped see the nation through important reckonings with  
First Amendment freedoms, racial equality and the Roe vs. Wade 
abortion decision for which he is best remembered, Justice Stephen 
G. Breyer said at a memorial service Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died Thursday at 90. First lady Hillary Clinton,  
Supreme Court colleagues and Attorney General Janet Reno also 
attended the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the memorial service, Blackmun's cremated remains were  
taken to Arlington National Cemetery in an unusual hearse. Among 
the black limousines carrying family and friends was a light blue 
Volkswagen Beetle, like the one the justice drove to work for 
years, which carried the cremation urn. 
</P>
<P>
	As unusually heavy snow fell on Washington, a fellow native  
Minnesotan, humorist Garrison Keillor, led mourners in singing the 
Irish lullaby ``Toura Loura, Loura.'' Keillor said it was a 
Blackmun favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer, who succeeded Blackmun on the court, said in Blackmun's  
24-year tenure he ``made a direct, conscious effort to reach out 
and understand those whose life experience was different from his 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trained as a mathematician, Blackmun retired from the court in  
1994 at age 85 because, he said, he knew ``what the numbers are,'' 
and it was time to go, Breyer remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun got tens of thousands of letters after he wrote the  
1973 Roe vs. Wade opinion that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	One very long letter urged Blackmun to resign, Breyer said, and  
the justice's reply was succinct: ``Dear Sir, No. Sincerely, Harry 
A. Blackmun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Koh, a former Blackmun law clerk and now an assistant  
secretary of state, called him ``the people's justice'' who 
``through quiet courage and sheer hard work became the conscience 
of our court in the late 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months before his retirement, Blackmun repudiated his  
career-long acceptance of capital punishment and declared himself 
opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter, Nancy Blackmun, said his long hours at work  
limited his time with his family, but she added that for his three 
daughters, ``his were the most comforting hands to hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William A. Holmes of said Blackmun brought to religion  
and the law ``a creative fidelity marked by humility, and always 
with a twinkle in his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton sat beside Blackmun's widow, Dorothy, in the front  
row of the Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church, where the 
Blackmuns were regular worshipers. Across the aisle were Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist, seven of the eight associate 
justices, and retired Justice Byron R. White -- the only living 
retired justice. Justice Antonin Scalia was out of town due to an 
illness in the family.
