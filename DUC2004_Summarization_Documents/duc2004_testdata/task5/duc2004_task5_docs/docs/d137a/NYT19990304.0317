<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun,
whose landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion ignited a
still-raging national debate, died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, 90, who served on the court from 1970 to 1994, died in
Arlington, Va., from complications after hip-replacement surgery
Feb. 23, the Supreme Court announced.
</P>
<P>
   The former justice will be remembered as the author of Roe vs.
Wade, the high court's controversial ruling that women have a
constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy during its first
trimester.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his renown as the ``author of the abortion
decision'' 10 years later, Blackmun repeated the phrase slowly and
said: ``We all pick up tabs. I'll carry this one to my grave.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton referred approvingly to Roe vs. Wade on
Thursday as he praised Blackmun for having served on the court with
``compassion, distinction and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see his mind and heart at work in the landmark
decision he wrote protecting women's right to reproductive freedom
and in his decisions to make the promise of civil rights actually
come alive in the daily existence of the American people,'' Clinton
said. ``He did justice and he loved mercy and now he walks humbly
with his God.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who opposes the decision,
nevertheless had nothing but praise for Blackmun upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a worthy successor to the predecessors in the seat
which he occupied,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, another ardent opponent of the Roe
decision, also hailed his former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was more dedicated to the rule of law or more
painstaking in the execution of his responsibilities on this court
than Harry Blackmun,'' Scalia wrote. ``He was a good man and a good
justice, deserving the respect of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon nominated Blackmun, then a federal appeals court
judge in Minnesota, to the high court April 14, 1970 _ after the
Senate rejected Nixon's first two conservative choices for the
bench, Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell. Blackmun
never forgot that he was a third choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always kept me a little on the humble side to know that
there are other factors in life rather than I being the first
selection, which I was not,'' Blackmun said in a 1995 interview.
</P>
<P>
   In taking his seat on the court June 9, 1970, Blackmun joined
his childhood friend from Minnesota, Chief Justice Warren Burger.
The press quickly dubbed them the ``Minnesota Twins'' because they
often voted along the same conservative lines in ruling for the
government in law-and-order and welfare-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackmun's reputation as a conservative quickly changed
after a pregnant Dallas woman, Norma McCorvey, challenged an 1854
Texas law that made it illegal to perform an abortion. McCorvey,
referred to in court papers as Jane Roe, argued through lawyer
Sarah Weddington of Austin that the Texas statute and similar
anti-abortion laws in most states violated the constitutional right
to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his Roe vs. Wade decision Jan. 22, 1973, Blackmun wrote,
``The Constitution nowhere mentions a specific right of personal
choice in matters of marriage and family life, but the liberty
protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
covers more than those freedoms explicitly named in the Bill of
Rights. That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to
decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Keith Ellison, who clerked for Blackmun during
the high court's 1977-78 term, remembered the former justice as ``a
private man of extraordinary rectitude.'' Blackmun ``did not choose
to be the epicenter of the abortion debate,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply decided a case that the Constitution required him to
decide and wrote an opinion that the chief justice asked him to
write,'' Ellison added. ``He never doubted that it was a difficult
decision about which honorable people could and would disagree. He
paid a horrific price for a role he never sought, but which his
conscience would not allow him to avoid.''

<P>
   Harvard University law Professor Laurence Tribe, who argued more
than 20 cases before Blackmun, said what he will remember most
about the justice was his change from a conservative to one of the
court's last liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe noted Blackmun's change of heart on the death penalty,
which he supported until he had a public change of heart shortly
before his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tone deaf on issues of poverty,'' Tribe said, referring
to Blackmun's initial decisions. But over time the justice came to
realize ``there is a world out there with people who don't have
power and resources,'' Tribe added.
</P>
<P>
   The professor also remembered Blackmun as a gentle questioner of
lawyers, asking primarily factual questions about how the case
proceeded in lower courts rather than hypothetical inquiries about
how the law would apply. But Tribe said Blackmun ``could get quite
ferocious'' in grilling lawyers who dared to argue in favor of
weakening Roe vs. Wade.

   Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the National Organization
for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund, cited his 1991 decision
that women of child-bearing age may work in areas that might harm
fetuses as evidence of his championship of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun wrote for a divided court that a woman, not her
employers, must decide whether she wants to work in a dangerous
environment. ``Justice Blackmun will be remembered as a forceful
champion of women's rights and a defender of individual liberty,''
Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   But David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said he holds the former justice in a different
regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will remember Harry Blackmun as the architect of the
tragic U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade,'' O'Steen said.
``It is a tragedy for someone to go to his grave best remembered
for denying unborn children the most basic civil liberty _ the
right to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born Nov. 12, 1908, in Nashville,
Ill., but was raised in St. Paul, Minn. After earning his
bachelor's and law degrees from Harvard University, he returned to
his hometown in 1932 and spent a year as a law clerk for 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge John B. Sanborn.

   Blackmun then joined the Minneapolis law firm Dorsey, Colman,
Barker, Scott &AMP; Barber, where he specialized in tax and probate
law. In 1950, he left the firm to become general counsel of the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Blackmun to the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1959. Blackmun remained on the
appeals court until Nixon picked him to fill the vacancy left when
Justice Abe Fortas resigned.
</P>
<P>
   After Blackmun retired from the court Aug. 3, 1994, Clinton
chose Stephen G. Breyer to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun is survived by his wife, Dorothy, whom he married in
1941; three daughters, Nancy, of Framingham, Mass, and Sally and
Susan, of Orlando, Fla.; and five grandchildren
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements have not been announced.
