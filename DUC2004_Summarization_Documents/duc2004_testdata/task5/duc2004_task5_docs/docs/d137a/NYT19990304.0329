   WASHINGTON _ Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a modest midwestern
Republican who became a passionate defender of the right to
abortion during 24 years on the Supreme Court, died Thursday at the
age of 90.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, who retired from the court five years ago, died of
complications following hip replacement surgery, the court
announced. He underwent the procedure last week, following a fall
at his home in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In his retirement, he was a frequent visitor to the court, where
staff members and former law clerks helped celebrate his 90th
birthday in November. He made his movie debut in 1997, playing a
cameo role as Justice Joseph Story in the Stephen Spielberg film
``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun was well aware that despite an active, 62-year career
as a lawyer and judge, his name would be forever linked to the
issue of abortion and to the opinion that bore his signature, Roe
vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   When Harry Blackmun took his seat on the Supreme Court on June
9, 1970, few people would have predicted that this soft-spoken,
61-year-old judge, a lifelong Republican never known for breaking
new ground or challenging the status quo, was about to embark on an
extraordinary personal journey that by the time he retired 24 years
later would find him as one of the last remaining liberal voices on
a transformed court.
</P>
<P>
   Not even three years into his tenure, Blackmun guaranteed his
place in the country's judicial, political and social history as
the author of Roe vs. Wade, the decision that established a
constitutional right for women to obtain abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In that opinion, on which Blackmun labored for more than a year,
the court found constitutional protection for ``a right of personal
privacy'' that is ``broad enough to encompass a woman's decision
whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Roe vs. Wade was 7-2, an indication that far from
being solely the product of Blackmun's personal vision, the
decision reflected a broad consensus on the court that the time had
come to end the criminal prohibitions against abortion that in 1973
were still retained by most states. Even such a conservative member
of the court as Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Blackmun's boyhood
friend from St. Paul, Minn., joined the opinion that he had
assigned Blackmun to write.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was Blackmun who became the personal symbol of
the abortion issue that assumed an increasingly dominant, and
divisive, role in U.S. politics. Abortion opponents flooded his
chambers at the court with tens of thousands of letters. ``Think of
any name; I've been called it in these letters,'' he said in a 1983
interview. When he appeared in public, even years after the
decision, Blackmun was sometimes confronted by pickets and
hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his career on the court, as the majority in
favor of a constitutional right to abortion dwindled, Blackmun
became another kind of symbol as a grim survivor of what looked
like a judicial counter-revolution. In 1989, the court voted in
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services to uphold a Missouri law
that restricted access to abortion. The 5-4 decision did not
overturn Roe vs. Wade, but indicated that the framework of the 1973
decision no longer commanded a majority on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, then 80, read his dissenting opinion in a tense and
hushed courtroom. ``I fear for the future,'' he said. ``The signs
are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent retirements of Justices William J. Brennan in
1990 and Thurgood Marshall the next year left Blackmun as the only
remaining member of the Roe vs. Wade majority still serving on the
court. Roe vs. Wade did indeed appear doomed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1992 decision that took much of the country by
surprise, a new majority coalesced to preserve and even to solidify
the constitutional right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The plurality opinion in that case, Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey, reaffirmed what it called the ``essential holding'' of Roe
vs. Wade, the right of a woman to choose abortion during the first
six months of pregnancy, before the fetus is able to live outside
the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun did not agree with all of the plurality's opinion. He
would have struck down all the abortion regulations in the
Pennsylvania law that was before the court, while the plurality
opinion upheld most of them.
</P>
<P>
   But he signed the portion of the opinion reaffirming the
constitutional framework for the right to abortion. ``Just when
many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright,''
he wrote in a separate opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun also used his separate opinion to underscore the
fragility of the court's support for the right to abortion, since a
dissenting opinion signed by four justices had called for Roe vs.
Wade to be overturned. ``I fear for the darkness as four justices
anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the
light,'' he said, adding: ``I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on
this court forever.'' He predicted a fierce confirmation battle for
whoever was named to succeed to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   But that battle did not materialize. By the time Blackmun
announced, on April 6, 1994, that he would retire at the end of
court's 1993-94 term, a Democrat was in the White House. The margin
of support for abortion rights on the court was a solid 6-3, the
result of President Bill Clinton's choice of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to
replace Justice Byron R. White, a long-time opponent of Roe vs.
Wade who retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed Blackmun, Clinton chose Stephen G. Breyer, a federal
appeals court judge who was widely assumed to support abortion
rights. Breyer was easily confirmed after a four-day hearing in
which the right to abortion _ no longer perceived as being at stake
_ never became an issue.
</P>
<P>
   During his first few years on the court, Blackmun's votes so
closely paralleled those of the chief justice, Burger, that he
appeared to be in his old friend's shadow. While the two were
popularly identified as the ``Minnesota Twins,'' the derisive label
also carried the clear implication that Blackmun was the junior
twin.
</P>
<P>
   The label lingered after it had long become outdated. By the
court's 1985-86 term, Burger's last year on the bench, the two were
voting together less than half the time in cases in which the court
was not unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   In civil liberties cases, particularly, Blackmun was much more
likely to vote with Justices Brennan and Marshall than with the
court's conservatives. By the end of his career, after those two
justices had retired and Blackmun became the court's senior
associate justice, his was the most reliable voice for civil
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's survivors include his wife, the former Dorothy Clark,
and their daughters, Dr. Nancy C. Blackmun, a psychologist, of
Framingham, Mass.; Sally Ann Blackmun, a lawyer, of Orlando, Fla.,
and Susan Blackmun, a freelance writer, also of Orlando, and five
grandchildren.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born Nov. 12, 1908, in Nashville,
Ill., the son of Corwin Manning Blackmun and the former Theo
Reuter. The family moved to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area when he
was a small child.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, the Harvard Club of Minnesota offered
Blackmun a scholarship to Harvard, where he compiled an impressive
academic record. Faced with a close choice between law school and
medical school, he chose Harvard Law School but retained a lifelong
interest in and respect for the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   He did well in law school, graduating in 1932 and accepting a
federal appeals court clerkship back in Minnesota with an 8th
Circuit judge, John B. Sanborn.
</P>
<P>
   After his clerkship, he taught for a year at a local law school,
the St. Paul College of Law, now known as the William Mitchell
College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun then joined a prestigious Minneapolis law firm, Dorsey,
Colman, Barker, Scott &AMP; Barber. He spent 16 years there, working on
tax and estate cases and on the firm's longtime representation of
the Mayo Clinic, the well-known medical research and treatment
center in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he left private practice to become general counsel of
the clinic. He spent nearly 10 years in that position, a period he
later said was the happiest in his professional life. The job let
him apply his legal skills to his lifelong interest in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's appointment to the Supreme Court was the result of
political happenstance. He was Nixon's third choice to fill the
vacancy created by the forced resignation of Justice Abe Fortas.
The Senate rejected Nixon's first two choices, Clement F.
Haynsworth Jr., a federal appeals court judge from South Carolina,
and G. Harrold Carswell, a federal district judge from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action frustrated the Nixon administration's plan
to name a Southerner to the court. Nixon then looked north in
search of a noncontroversial nominee who could be easily confirmed
and who at the same time would fit the requirement the president
had set for a ``law and order'' judge.
</P>
<P>
   Burger, whom Nixon had named to the Supreme Court the year
before, suggested his friend Harry Blackmun. Within a month,
Blackmun was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 94-0. The Supreme
Court seat once occupied by such justices as Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Benjamin N. Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter had been vacant for a
year by the time Blackmun took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the events that led to his nomination, Blackmun later
referred to himself wryly as ``Old Number Three.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the court, few tourists would have picked Harry Blackmun
out as a justice. He never acquired a trace of self-importance. He
was modest in both his manner and appearance, rarely wearing a suit
to work. He was a good storyteller and excellent mimic, using that
skill to devastating effect in deadpan impersonations of his
colleagues on the court. Trim and sprightly even in advanced age,
he exercised daily in the Supreme Court gym.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, nothing else Blackmun ever wrote had as great an
effect or was scrutinized as carefully as his 50-page opinion in
Roe vs. Wade, issued on Jan. 22, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of his career, Blackmun regarded Roe vs. Wade
with pride and a fierce attachment. ``If it goes down the drain,''
he told a group of law students in 1986, ``I'd still like to regard
Roe vs. Wade as a landmark in the progress of the emancipation of
women.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired at the age of 85, Blackmun was the
third-oldest person ever to serve on the court. Only Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes, who retired at age 90, and Chief Justice Roger B.
Taney, who died in office at 87, were older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the numbers are, and it's time,'' Blackmun said as
he stood with Clinton at a White House press conference on April 6,
1994. The president praised him warmly. ``Justice has not only been
his title, it has been his guiding light,'' Clinton said.
