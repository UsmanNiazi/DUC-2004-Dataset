<P>
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the
court's 1973 opinion in Roe v. Wade which legalized abortion
nationwide, died early Thursday in Arlington, Va. He was 90. The
cause of death was complications following a hip-replacement
operation on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton hailed Justice Blackmun's
``uncanny feel for the human element that lies just beneath the
surface of all serious legal argument'' and noted that ``In 24
years on the Supreme Court, he served with compassion, distinction
and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun was an associate justice from 1970 to 1995. At
the time of his retirement, he was 85, the third-oldest man to
serve on the court, after Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who retired at
90, and Chief Justice Roger Taney, who died at 87.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he retired, Justice Blackmun had become a liberal
hero. Many observers attributed his leftward shift to the attacks
he suffered as the author of Roe. Justice Blackmun himself always
said that he hadn't gotten more liberal, but rather the court had
gotten more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of cause, his defense of abortion rights, opposition
to the death penalty, and commitment to civil liberties were not
the attributes of the man President Richard M. Nixon hailed as a
``strict constructionist'' when he named Blackmun to the court.
</P>
<P>
   That Justice Blackmun was one of three dissenters when the court
ruled in 1971 in the so-called ``Pentagon Papers'' case that the
government could not prevent The New York Times from publishing a
secret Defense Department history of US involvement in Indochina.
That Harry Blackmun remained recognizable two years later in an
opinion in a case concerning a welfare recipient unable to file a
$50 bankruptcy fee. Paying the fee on the installment plan ``should
be within his able-bodied reach,'' Justice Blackmun wrote, in a
statement some observers considered callous. Yet a mere four years
later, he declared in a dissent on a court ruling against abortion
funding, ``There is another world `out there,' the existence of
which the court, I suspect, either chooses to ignore or fears to
recognize.. . . This is a sad day for those who regard the
Constitution as a force that would serve justice to all
evenhandedly and, in so doing, would better the lot of the poorest
among us.''
</P>
<P>
   What may well have been Justice Blackmun's most ringing
statement of liberal jurisprudence came during his final year on
the bench in his dissent from a court refusal to hear the appeal of
a death row inmate. ``From this day forward, I no longer shall
tinker with the machinery of death,'' Justice Blackmun declared.
``I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede
that the death penalty experiment has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun liked to jokingly refer to himself as ``Old
Number Three.'' He was named to the court only after the Senate had
rejected two previous Nixon nominees to the seat that had been held
by Justice Abe Fortas: US Appellate judges Clement Haynsworth and
G. Harrold Carswell. Nixon appointed Justice Blackmun at the urging
of Chief Justice Warren Burger, a longtime friend. The two were
immediately dubbed the ``Minnesota Twins'' (a tribute to their
native state). Burger proved to be the predictably conservative
justice Nixon had hoped for. Justice Blackmun, however, resented
Burger's taking his vote for granted and soon demonstrated his
judicial independence.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burger who assigned the Roe opinion to Blackmun. ``I
still think it was a correct decision,'' Justice Blackmun said in
an interview on the occasion of Roe's 10th anniversary. ``We were
deciding a constitutional issue, not a moral one.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion won Justice Blackmun the intense admiration of
liberals and feminists. Norman Dorsen, former president of the
American Civil Liberties Union, spoke for many when in a 1985
article he called the decision ``famous as a human charter of
liberty for women who wish to control their lives and reproductive
destinies.'' Thursday, Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood, hailed Justice Blackmun as ``a great humanitarian _ a
true 20th-century hero who will be remembered well into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   It also won him the equally intense enmity of abortion
opponents. Public appearances by the justice invariably drew
pickets. Among the epithets hurled at him, he once recalled, were
``butcher of Dachau, murderer, Pontius Pilate, King Herod _ you
name it.'' Ten years after the decision, he was still receiving
eight to 10 letters a day. ``Some are very supportive, very lovely
messages,'' he explained. ``But most are very abusive. The more
recent ones are as abusive as initial ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The one area where Justice Blackmun's Roe opinion tended to
inspire unanimity was among legal scholars, many of whom agreed
with its result but very few with its often tortured reasoning. A
slow writer, Justice Blackmun was affectionately called ``Fast
Harry'' by his clerks, and the combination of his lack of fluency
and the complexity of the subject made for an unsatisfactory
opinion. As Georgetown University law professor Mark Tushnet once
wrote in the Harvard Law Review, ``It seems to be generally agreed
that, as a matter of simple craft, Justice Blackmun's decision for
the Court was dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun remained both proud and protective of Roe. When
the court came as close as it ever has to overturning the decision,
in its 1989 ruling in Webster v. Reproductive Human Services,
Justice Blackmun concluded his dissent with an almost-shocking
directness. ``For today, the women of this nation still retain the
liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and
ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when the court affirmed Roe in Planned
Parenthood v. Casey, it became even clearer how personally Justice
Blackmun had come to feel about Roe. ``I am 83 years old,'' he
wrote in a concurring opinion. ``I cannot remain on this court
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Andrew Blackmun was born on Nov. 12, 1908, in Nashville,
Ill., the son of Corwin Manning Blackmun and Theo (Reuter)
Blackmun. The Blackmuns soon moved to St. Paul, Minn., where one of
Justice Blackmun's schoolmates was Burger. The two delivered
newspapers and played tennis together; some years later, Justice
Blackmun was best man at Burger's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   He was graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from Harvard in
1929 and three years later earned his law degree there. After a
year clerking for US Appellate Judge John Sanborn, whose seat he
would later fill, Justice Blackmun practiced law at a large
Minneapolis firm until 1950. That year, he became legal counsel to
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. His medical background would
later be cited as a key influence on the Roe opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Justice
Blackmun to the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. During the
11 years before his ascent to the high court, Justice Blackmun
earned a reputation for being moderately liberal in civil rights
and civil liberties cases and moderately conservative in criminal
justice cases. Perhaps because of his mathematical background, he
excelled at tax cases (a talent that his Supreme Court colleagues
came to particularly value because, as Justice William J. Brennan
Jr. put it, in that field ``the rest of us are so stupid'').
</P>
<P>
   Justice Blackmun leaves his wife, Dorothy, three daughters,
Nancy, Sally, and Susan, and five grandchildren.
