<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Praises Harry Blackmun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist today noted  
``with sadness'' the death last week of retired Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun and expressed the court's sympathy to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from the bench during the court's brief morning  
session, the chief justice said Blackmun ``was a worthy successor 
to the predecessors in the seat which he occupied -- Joseph Story, 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Benjamin Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be missed by his friends throughout the judiciary and  
the country,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice said Blackmun's opinion in the Roe vs. Wade  
ruling that legalized abortion nationwide ``may have obscured many 
other important decisions he authored.'' Blackmun wrote more than 
350 majority decisions for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun served for 24 years on the nation's highest court and  
retired in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was to lie in repose in the court building's Great Hall  
this afternoon. A memorial service was scheduled for Tuesday in 
Washington D.C.
