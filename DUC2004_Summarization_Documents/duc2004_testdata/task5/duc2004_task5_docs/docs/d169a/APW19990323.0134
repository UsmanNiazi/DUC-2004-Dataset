<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Jurors See Tape of Death </HEADLINE>

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury today watched a videotape of Dr.  
Jack Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to Thomas Youk, the man 
with Lou Gehrig's disease he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape started with Kevorkian interviewing Youk, 52, about his  
illness, which forced him to use a feeding tube and was 
progressively depriving him of control of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	On camera, Kevorkian asks Youk if he wants to go ahead and end  
his life. Youk indicates he does, and Kevorkian hands him a pen to 
sign a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait a week and see how you feel in a week. Is that all  
right with you, Tom?'' Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape resumes later.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian then begins preparing an intravenous line for Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to inject. We're going to inject in your right  
arm,'' Kevorkian says. A hand is shown injecting drugs into Youk's 
intravenous line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a straight line. ... His heart is stopped,''  
Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance in the Sept. 17, 1998, death of Youk. Portions 
of the video of Youk's death were shown in November on CBS' ``60 
Minutes;'' today, jurors saw the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Monday with selection of a jury of 12 members  
and two alternates, followed by opening arguments. Kevorkian, 
acting as his own attorney, gave the defense statement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I despise a human being dying at my hands. But my intent isn't  
to kill a person. I am forced by my position as a physician to do 
this,'' Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury was not present to hear most of Kevorkian's  
argument. Less than three minutes into his statement, Oakland 
County Assistant Prosecutor John Skrzynski objected, contending 
that Kevorkian was arguing law, rather than summarizing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper agreed, saying Kevorkian needed to  
argue the facts, not the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, a retired pathologist who says he's been present for  
more than 130 deaths, insists he committed no crime. He 
rhetorically asked jurors why he would have recorded Youk's death 
had he thought it murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone with reason or common sense believe I would do all  
that knowing it was a crime and give it to `60 Minutes'?'' 
Kevorkian said. ``My intent was not to murder Tom Youk, and the 
evidence will show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, has faced trial four times before on assisted  
suicide charges, with cases ending in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	He dared prosecutors to do something about the Youk case. A  
conviction would mean a mandatory sentence of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	in his statement, Skrzynski urged the jury to remember that  
despite the publicity surrounding Kevorkian, the defendant is not 
above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Begin to focus on what Jack Kevorkian does, and what Jack  
Kevorkian says, and what you will see is a man breaking the law,'' 
Skrzynski said. ``Jack Kevorkian killed Tom Youk, and Jack 
Kevorkian does not have the right to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skrzynski said Youk's death does not qualify as an assisted  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Youk did not kill himself with Jack Kevorkian's help. Jack  
Kevorkian killed Tom Youk by injecting him with drugs,'' the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	While representing himself, Kevorkian will be allowed to consult  
with lawyers David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer. Defending himself, he 
said, was ``what I've planned all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge expressed misgivings about allowing Kevorkian to serve  
as his own lawyer, asking him, ``Do you understand you could spend 
the rest of your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' he responded.
