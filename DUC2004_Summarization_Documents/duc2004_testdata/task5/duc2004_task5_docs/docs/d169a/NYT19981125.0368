MICHIGAN PROSECUTOR BRINGS MURDER CHARGES AGAINST KEVORKIAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A Michigan prosecutor on Wednesday brought first-degree murder
charges against Dr. Jack Kevorkian for administering a lethal
injection last September to a terminally ill man who wished to die,
a videotaped act of euthanasia that was nationally televised on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   David Gorcyca, the prosecutor for Oakland County, said
Kevorkian's actions clearly fit the definition of premeditated
murder, and that the consent of the dying man, who had Lou Gehrig's
disease, was no legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   While Kevorkian claims to have presided over more than 120
suicides, this case was the first in which he took a direct role in
causing a death. If convicted, he could face a sentence of life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered to the police on Wednesday afternoon in Waterford
Township, a suburb of Detroit, and was later released on a $750,000
personal bond, on the condition that he not participate in any
assisted suicides. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, there is an obvious violation of the law,'' the
prosecutor said, ``which I will not turn my back to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, 70, had virtually dared legal authorities to charge
him, or implicitly acknowledge that people have the right to end
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must charge me _ because if they do not that means they
do not think it was a crime,'' Kevorkian said when the videotape of
the death of Thomas Youk, 52, was shown on ``60 Minutes,'' a CBS
News show that was viewed in more than 15 million households.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the debate over assisted suicide and
euthanasia applauded the filing of formal charges, both calling for
a showdown on an issue that goes to core philosophies of life and
liberty. But legal experts said that prosecutors might be at a
disadvantage because a jury might find it easy to sympathize with
the sufferings of the terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Girsh, executive director of the Hemlock Society, which
advocates the rights of people to end their lives, said the
Michigan prosecutor's decision to file charges was legally
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was what Jack Kevorkian wanted,'' said Ms. Girsh. ``He
chose to do this to make a point to the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that three juries had failed to convict Kevorkian in
earlier cases of assisted suicides, Ms. Girsh said it was
``questionable whether a jury of 12 citizens'' would convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Smith, a lawyer for the International Anti-Euthanasia
Task Force who is a critic of Kevorkian, said of the charges filed
against Kevorkian, ``It's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Unless the rule of law means nothing in this
country, Jack Kevorkian belongs in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association issued a statement on Tuesday
that condemned Kevorkian as ``a self-admitted zealot killing
another human being to advance his own interests and ego-driven
urge to martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan law that took effect on Sept. 1 forbids assisted
suicide. A statewide vote on a measure that would have legalized
assisted suicide, under certain circumstances, was defeated on Nov.
3 by a margin of 71 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, whose license to practice medicine has been revoked
in Michigan and California, was tried and acquitted three times on
charges related to the deaths of five people in Michigan between
1994 and 1996. A fourth case ended in mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   On ``60 Minutes,'' Kevorkian said that if he were sent to
prison, he would starve himself.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Oakland Press of Michigan, Kevorkian
said that he wanted to be charged. ``I want to be prosecuted for
euthanasia,'' he told the newspaper. ``I am going to prove that
this is not a crime, ever, regardless of what words are written on
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``tired of all the hypocrisy,'' adding, ``we're
going to end this, one way or another.''
</P>

<P>
   Kevorkian had given the videotape to CBS, which later turned it
over to prosecutors. Mike Wallace, a reporter on the show, said the
tape was handed over because ``it belonged to Dr. Kevorkian,'' and
that is what he wished to be done.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Kevorkian is shown presenting a consent form to
Youk, who then signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, on Sept. 17, Kevorkian is shown injecting Youk
with drugs to make him sleep, then stop breathing, and then stop
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   When asked during the broadcast if he had killed Youk, Kevorkian
replied, ``I did.''
