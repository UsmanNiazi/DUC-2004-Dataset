<HEADLINE>  Judge Sentences Kevorkian to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's crusade for assisted  
suicide began nine years ago in the back of his rusted Volkswagen 
van. There, an Alzheimer's patient from Oregon pushed a button on 
the retired pathologist's ``suicide machine'' and lethal drugs 
flowed into her veins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has skirted the law and taunted its enforcers ever  
since, helping 130 people take their own lives He left bodies in 
the middle of the night at motels, others at hospital emergency 
rooms. He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in 
costume and challenged authorities to do something about it. On 
Tuesday, they finally did. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you,'' said 
Judge Jessica Cooper. ``Well, sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper sentenced the Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for  
the second-degree murder of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's patient 
whom Kevorkian videotaped as he injected him with a lethal cocktail 
of chemicals on Sept. 17. The videotape was later broadcast on 
CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband had come to the end of his life as he chose to,''  
Melody Youk said as she pleaded for a lenient sentence. ``He was 
not depressed. He was not a victim. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's 
help and was grateful for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also sentenced Kevorkian to three to seven years for  
delivery of a controlled substance. The sentences will run 
concurrently, and Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after six 
years and eight months, a prosecutor said. Kevorkian, who turns 71 
next month, could have gotten life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's supporters said the sentence would intensify the  
debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to spark more debate and discussion on the  
end of life issue,'' said Nicholle McClelland, spokeswoman for the 
Oregon-based Hemlock Society. ``This was not murder, this was a 
very compassionate act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McClelland said laws against assisted suicide should be on  
trial, not Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another example ... that the law needs to change to  
allow for physician-assisted dying,'' she said. ``Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian is one of those responsible for making the movement so 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the sentence was long overdue. Members of Not  
Dead Yet, a disabled rights group, celebrated the end of what one 
called Kevorkian's ``killing spree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Kevorkian has been killing members of the disabled  
community for years and has been getting away with it,'' said Cal 
Montgomery. ``I hope this is the end of the euthanasia movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement, saying  
Kevorkian's ```final solution' approach to pain management has been 
an unconscionable exploitation of the natural ambivalence to death 
and suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence, said archdiocese spokesman Ned McGrath, leaves  
``no doubt that society will neither authorize physicians to kill 
nor look the other way if they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Judge Cooper offered her take on the impact of the  
sentence, telling Kevorkian the debate over assisted suicide will 
continue ``long after this trial and your activities fade from 
public memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Youk, 52, was confined to a  
wheelchair, had a feeding tube installed in his stomach and was 
afraid of choking on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners considered the death suspicious. But they had  
little to go on -- until Kevorkian sent the videotape to ``60 
Minutes.'' The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were 
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, who says he has  
been involved in 130 deaths since 1990, and the first time he was 
found guilty of taking part in a death. His previous trials, all on 
assisted-suicide charges, resulted in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In past cases, Kevorkian said his patients used his homemade  
devices to start the flow of carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that caused their death. In Youk's case, Kevorkian 
administered the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's brash legal bulldog for much of the  
past nine years, refused to defend him, claiming Kevorkian had 
turned a corner to self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian insisted on representing himself at his short trial,  
where he gave an impassioned but ineffective defense interrupted 
often by prosecutors' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer?''  
Kevorkian asked the jury. ``If you do, then you must convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was taken to the state prison at Jackson, where  
officials will evaluate him and determine whether to send him to a 
minimum-, medium- or maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison, a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. He 
has staged two hunger strikes in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth predicted the conviction  
will be reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as far as he's concerned he thinks that what he did  
was proper,'' he said. ``He knew the risks, and in order to move 
the process he took the risks.''
