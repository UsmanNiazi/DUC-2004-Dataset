<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Withdraws As Own Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian fired himself as his  
attorney Friday as jurors went into their second day of 
deliberating whether to convict him of murder for the nationally 
televised death of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, accused of murdering 52-year-old Thomas Youk with a  
lethal injection, turned his defense over to attorney David Gorosh, 
who had been serving as the retired pathologist's legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take your good advice and withdraw,'' Kevorkian  
told Judge Jessica Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you're going to do it?'' replied Cooper, who suggested to  
Kevorkian throughout the brief trial that he get himself a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You said any time, your honor.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian stumbled over legal procedure several times during the  
trial and unsuccessfully tried to persuade the judge to let him 
call Youk's widow and brother as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the jury continued hashing out Kevorkian's fate after  
spending five hours deliberating the case on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, could get life in prison if convicted. He has  
been tried four times on assisted suicide charges, with three 
acquittals and one mistrial. This is the first time he has stood 
trial on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
suicides since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The injection death of Youk was videotaped and later shown on  
``60 Minutes'' in a segment that included Kevorkian daring 
prosecutors to charge him. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Kevorkian told jurors that history would  
judge them harshly for a guilty verdict and suggested they should 
trust their judgment more than the law. He contended his intent was 
not to kill Youk, but merely to relieve his suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John Skrzynski said Kevorkian should not be allowed  
to make a political statement with Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	In her instructions to the jury, Cooper said euthanasia or mercy  
killing is not a defense to murder.
