<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Lawyer Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A lawyer for Dr. Jack Kevorkian asked a judge  
Friday to throw out his murder conviction, saying he had bad legal 
advice -- even though Kevorkian defended himself at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Mayer Morganroth blamed Kevorkian's lawyer, David Gorosh,  
for ``ineffective assistance of counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth alleged that Kevorkian acted as his own attorney out  
of frustration over the way Gorosh was handling the defense, The 
Oakland Press of Pontiac reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blame for the deficiencies in presenting a defense on  
behalf of Dr. Kevorkian falls squarely on the shoulders of Gorosh, 
who failed to effectively perform his dual roles as advocate and 
adviser,'' Morganroth wrote. ``Gorosh was more interested in 
talking to the media than the defense team and his client, Dr. 
Kevorkian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charge came as a surprise to Gorosh.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see Dr. Kevorkian get a new trial, but not through  
a method that is untrue,'' Gorosh said. ``Frankly, we always 
offered him a number of options. It was his own choice to defend 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth refused to provide a copy of the 20-page motion,  
filed as the court clerk's office closed Friday. He would not say 
who he thought gave bad legal counsel or answer further questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for second-degree  
murder and delivery of a controlled substance in the injection 
death of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's disease patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's longtime lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, said he was not  
asked to defend Kevorkian in the Youk case. Gorosh, a former Fieger 
employee fired over Kevorkian's defense in a misdemeanor trial, 
began representing Kevorkian after the charges were filed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorosh and attorney Lisa Dwyer filed motions and argued for  
Kevorkian during his preliminary hearing. But the night before the 
trial began, Kevorkian decided to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kevorkian handled his own defense, Gorosh and Ms. Dwyer  
whispered advice to him throughout the trial. Gorosh said Kevorkian 
``listened to some advice and disregarded others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth, who had helped defend Kevorkian in two previous  
trials, dropped in on the last day of the criminal trial. Kevorkian 
asked for his help, and let Morganroth represent him during his 
sentencing. April 14.
