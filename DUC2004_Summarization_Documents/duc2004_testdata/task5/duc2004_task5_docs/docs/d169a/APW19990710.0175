<HEADLINE> State Wants Kevorkian Assets Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The state treasurer has filed a lawsuit  
against assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian in an attempt to 
charge him for the cost of keeping him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Oakland Circuit Court, asks the  
court to freeze all of Kevorkian's assets and to appoint a receiver 
-- in this case, the prison warden -- to control Kevorkian's funds, 
The Oakland Press reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint says Kevorkian is believed to have assets of  
$77,176 in a corporate bank account plus another $31,155 in another 
bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the 71-year-old Kevorkian was convicted of  
second-degree murder for the injection death of Lou Gehrig's 
patient Thomas Youk, and sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison. He 
is being held at the Oaks Correctional Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth told The Oakland Press he  
was aware of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to get it resolved,'' Morganroth said.  
``I think we are going to work this thing out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the state can take up to 90 percent of Kevorkian's  
assets to pay for prison, said Chris De Witt, spokesman for 
Attorney General Jennifer Granholm.
