<HEADLINE> ABC Allowed To Interview Kevorkian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A judge has ordered the state Department of
Corrections to allow ABC News an on-camera interview with jailed
assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Director Bill Martin refused the network's request
to interview Kevorkian and two other inmates in April 1999. ABC
sued, alleging the department arbitrarily and unconstitutionally
applied a new policy barring cameras and recording devices in the
state's 39 prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee County Circuit Judge Robert Ransom on Thursday ordered
Martin to allow the ABC newsmagazine ''20/20'' to bring its cameras
into the state prison and tape the interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Ransom agreed with the department's decision to keep the
other two inmates out of the TV camera's view.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, 72, is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for
second-degree murder and drug delivery. In Sept. 1999, he
videotaped himself injecting terminally ill Lou Gehrig's disease
sufferer Thomas Youk, 52, with lethal chemicals. Kevorkian gave the
tape to CBS' ''60 Minutes,'' which broadcast the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told Martin to schedule an interview between ABC
correspondent Barbara Walters and Kevorkian in the next two weeks
or face jail.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Department spokesman Matt Davis said the agency will
appeal Ransom's order.
