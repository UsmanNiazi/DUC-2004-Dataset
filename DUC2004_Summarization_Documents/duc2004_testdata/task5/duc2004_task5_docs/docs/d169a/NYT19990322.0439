KEVORKIAN TELLS JURY HE DID NOT INTEND TO KILLNHED 
</HEADLINE>

   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Acting as his own lawyer for the first time in
his five trials, Dr. Jack Kevorkian on Monday told a jury
considering murder charges against him that he did not intend to
kill a seriously ill Michigan man when he injected him with a
lethal dose of chemicals last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, who has said that he has presided over more than 130
suicides, said he was no more a criminal than is an executioner,
whose ``intent is to do his duty.''
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors objected to his arguments, Kevorkian told
Judge Jessica R. Cooper of Oakland County Circuit Court, with
jurors out of the courtroom: ``I despise a human being dying in my
hands. But my intent isn't to kill the person. I thought it was my
duty as a physician to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor, John Skrzynski, told the jury that the case
was about no broader issue than the death of Thomas Youk, a
52-year-old Michigan man who was suffering from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue you will decide is whether Jack Kevorkian has the
right to kill or whether he's accountable to the law and guilty of
murder,'' Skrzynski said in his opening statement. ``Jack Kevorkian
killed Tom Youk and Jack Kevorkian did not have the right to
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In four previous trials on charges of assisted suicide, juries
have acquitted Kevorkian three times and failed to reach a verdict
once. This time, Kevorkian decided to intensify the debate on
assisted suicide by actively administering the lethal drugs to Youk
in Youk's home last September, rather than setting up his ``suicide
machine'' that let patients inject themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian videotaped the injection and gave the tape to the CBS
News program ``60 Minutes.'' In the broadcast, Kevorkian said he
was daring prosecutors to charge him.
</P>
<P>
   After the broadcast of the videotape, prosecutors charged
Kevorkian with first-degree murder and delivery of a controlled
substance. They also charged him with assisted suicide, but dropped
that count in an apparent effort to prevent Kevorkian from
presenting evidence about Youk's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Before jury selection began early on Monday morning, Kevorkian
told Ms. Cooper that he was prepared to defend himself. This day in
court was something he had wanted for a long time, Kevorkian said,
adding that only he has a good enough understanding of his beliefs
to adequately present his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain points I can bring out better than any
attorney,'' he told the court during a thorough questioning session
in which Ms. Cooper tried to determine if Kevorkian understood the
risks of representing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been planning this all along,'' Kevorkian said.
</P>
<P>
   In the questioning, Ms. Cooper explained the weight of the
charges and the maximum penalty associated with both.
</P>
<P>
   When she cautioned Kevorkian that he was facing a prison term
that could last the rest of his life, he responded: ``There's not
that much of it left, Your Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian will enlist the legal advice of David Gorosh and Lisa
Dwyer, the two lawyers who had argued his case in pretrial
hearings, but they will serve only as advisers and be prohibited
from voicing objections, addressing the court or questioning
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said he urged Kevorkian not to represent himself, but
that Kevorkian told him over the weekend that he would not follow
that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised Dr. Kevorkian that in our opinion it was in his
best interest to have lawyers represent him,'' Gorosh said, ``but
it is his constitutional right to represent himself.''
