<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Not On Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>

	DETROIT (AP) -- Jack Kevorkian told his lawyer he has abandoned  
plans to go on a hunger strike and is being treated well at his new 
home -- a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in good spirits,'' lawyer Mayer Morganroth said Thursday,  
two days after Kevorkian was sentenced to 10 to 25 years behind 
bars for second-degree murder in an injection death last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the medical facilities are excellent, they gave him a  
checkup and he had a little high blood pressure, but that's about 
it,'' Morganroth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was sentenced, Kevorkian had told a newspaper he would  
begin a hunger strike immediately upon entering prison. But 
Morganroth said Kevorkian, 70, told him he was eating and would 
continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to starve, I don't have anyone for an appeal,''  
Morganroth said in today's Oakland Press of Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `Jack, if you're not here, how can we pursue the  
very cause we wanted to pursue through the Supreme Court? I have to 
have you. It's all meaningless without you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The same day Kevorkian went to prison, state prison officials  
said they had reversed their policy on force-feeding. Under the 
policy, Kevorkian would have been allowed to starve himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian injected Thomas Youk, 52, with a lethal cocktail of  
chemicals last Sept. 17 at Youk's request. The man suffering from 
Lou Gehrig's disease was confined to a wheelchair, had a feeding 
tube installed in his stomach and was afraid of choking to death on 
his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of the death to ``60 Minutes,'' hoping 
to force the issue of assisted suicide into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape and the CBS News show's interview with Kevorkian were  
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian said Youk's death was his first euthanasia, and the  
trial was his first on a murder charge. Previous trials on assisted 
suicide charges ended in three acquittals and a mistrial.
