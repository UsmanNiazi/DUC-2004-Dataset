 &HT;    Rudolph tab nears $25 million

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 31-month search for Atlanta Olympic bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has cost the FBI an estimated $11.2
million, bringing the publicly acknowledged cost of the search to
$24.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The total includes $13.4 million in state and federal expenses
estimated previously, plus the new FBI estimate issued in response
media requests.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has spent the most money during the intense search of
the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, where Rudolph
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   FBI expenses include salaries, benefits, travel, transportation,
supplies, services and equipment. However, the agency's estimate
spans only from Oct. 1, 1998, through Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities began searching for Rudolph on Jan. 29, 1998. That
morning, officials charge, he detonated a nail bomb at the New
Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham that killed an
off-duty police officer providing security at the abortion clinic
and maimed a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Rudolph disappeared into a part of the dense
Appalachians renowned for its hiking and whitewater rafting. A
heavily armed task force pursued him to Andrews, N.C., and hunkered
down for two years. The command post, a former textile mill leased
from the town, cost $5,250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   When leads cooled earlier this year, the Southeast Bomb Task
Force retreated to a token presence and closed the command center.
Its lead agent was reassigned to Washington. The last verified
sighting of Rudolph was in July 1998 near Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta bombings: the deadly
explosion at Centennial Olympic Park during the Atlanta Games on
July 27, 1996, and the blasts in 1997 at an abortion clinic in the
Atlanta area and The Otherside Lounge, a gay and lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   In March, task force chief Steve McCraw said there was no reason
to believe Rudolph was anywhere but in the forests of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you put a price tag on the investigation'' of
such an important terrorism suspect, McCraw said. ``Moreover, I
think it's imperative that would-be terrorists know that if they
commit such an act, the combined resources of local, state and
federal law enforcement agencies are going to be used to bring them
to justice.''
