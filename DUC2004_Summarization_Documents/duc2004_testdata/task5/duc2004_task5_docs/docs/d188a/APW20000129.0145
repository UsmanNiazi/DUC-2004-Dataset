   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A nurse who was seriously injured in the 1998
bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic is suing fugitive suspect Eric Robert
Rudolph, partly in an effort to block any profits he might receive from a book
or movie, her attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Lyons and her husband, Jeff, are also seeking damages in the suit
against Rudolph, which they filed Thursday in federal court.

   ``She feels very strongly that he should never profit from his conduct
involving the clinic,'' said her attorney, Scott Powell.

   Lyons was arriving for work when a bomb exploded Jan. 29, 1998, outside New
Woman All Women Health Care. The blast killed an off-duty Birmingham policeman.
Lyons lost her left eye and has undergone numerous operations.

<P>
   Rudolph is charged in six bombings, including the 1996 Centennial Park blast
during the Olympic Games in Atlanta that killed one person and injured 100
others.

   Law enforcement has searched for Rudolph for more than two years, focusing
on remote areas in western North Carolina near his home.
