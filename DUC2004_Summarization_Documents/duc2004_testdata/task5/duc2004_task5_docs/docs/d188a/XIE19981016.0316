WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Federal authorites charged
Eric Robert Rudolph the elusive fugitive sought in the bomb of
the Olympic park bombing of 1996 and two other Atlanta-area
terroist attacks Wedensday.
</P>
<P>
"This warrant moves us one step closer to ending a campaign of
violence," said John Magaw of the Bureau of Alcoho, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Olympics bombing, Rudolph was formally
charged in last year's attacks against a north Atlanta abortion
clinic and a local gay nightclub. Nine people were injured in
those explosions.
</P>
<P>
In Febraury, Rudolph was charged with this year's bombing of a
clinic in Birminghan. A police officer was killed and a nurse was
seriously injuired in the blast. Two people died and 100 were
injured in the Olympics bombing.
</P>
<P>
Nails and steel plates recovered from the Olympic park and
Atlanta clinic bomb sites were similar, authorites said. The
similarities helped authorities link Rudolph to the bombings,
they said. They would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
His name was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list this year,
and a 1 million U.S. dollars award has been offered for
information leading to his conviction.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the new charges, federal officials solicited the
public's help in capturing Rudolph. Attorney General Janet Reno
and FBI Director Louis Freeh released a photograph showing
Rudolph in khaki shorts and a green T-shirt that investigators
believe Rudolph was wearing in Atlanda the day of the Olympics
blast.
</P>
<P>
Since January, Rudolph has been the subject of a massive
manhunt focused in Nantahala National Forest in western North
Carolina, near his hometown of Murphy.
</P>
<P>
At times as many as 200 agents beat through the rugged terrain
searching for Rudolph, an experienced outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
"Eric Rudolph is on the run," Reno said. "Hundreds of agents
are on his tail."
</P>
<P>
Authorities fear that Rudolph is getting help, possibly from
anti-abortion sympathizers.
