<HEADLINE> Break-Ins Point to Bombing Suspect </HEADLINE>

	ANDREWS, N.C. (AP) -- Bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph may be  
the intruder who broke into up to 12 mountain homes from July to 
January to steal food and toilet paper or sometimes just to get a 
shower and a shave, a federal agent said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The break-ins were very similar and occurred in a defined area,  
said Woody Enderson of the Southeast Bomb Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do feel they are a strong indication of his presence,'' he  
said, despite the absence of hair or other evidence that might 
specifically link the break-ins to Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	The break-ins have happened since July, the last confirmed  
sighting of Rudolph, Enderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the break-ins as very significant in the hunt for  
Rudolph, the suspect in a fatal Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic 
bombing last year and others in Atlanta, including the 1996 Olympic 
Park bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, someone wouldn't go into someone's house to take a  
shower and shave,'' Enderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the leads, Enderson and other members of the task force  
announced a reduction in the number of agents involved in the 
search in the Nantahala Forest in western North Carolina. He did 
not give specifics on the reduction but said it had been planned 
for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Enderson reiterated a long-standing belief by members of the  
task force that all of their leads indicate that Rudolph is still 
in the area and that he is not receiving any help.
