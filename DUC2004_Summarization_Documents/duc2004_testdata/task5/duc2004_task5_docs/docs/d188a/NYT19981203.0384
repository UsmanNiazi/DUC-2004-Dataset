 &HT;    Rumors about Rudolph have residents riled

   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Dogs bark at unusual hours of the night. Food is
missing from houses. Residents report prowlers.
</P>
<P>
   That and other evidence convinces federal investigators that
Eric Robert Rudolph, suspect in the Olympic Park and Birmingham
abortion clinic bombings, remains in the rugged hills of western
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday at Andrews Memorial Park,
investigators said there's no information ``of any significance''
to conclude Rudolph has fled the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we develop such evidence or information, our focus
remains here in western North Carolina, and the Nantahala Forest,''
said Terry Turchie of the Southeast Bomb Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters used for survelliance, as well as medical and
transportation needs, will be used less on Wednesdays and not at
all Sundays to appease local churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   That is welcome news to Adelle Parker, a library assistant in
Andrews. ``They're so noisy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound in this mountain burg, like the one over the
weekend: Supposedly, a decaying body had been found in the forest.
Parker said she watched the news but never saw anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it fit, too,'' she said. ``A male. No one knew who he was.
And it was near the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   On its noon broadcast, a Winston-Salem, N.C., television station
_ WXII, an NBC affiliate _ reported receiving a letter ostensibly
signed by Rudolph. The author said he was innocent of federal
charges and that he was the target of an operation that was costing
the taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a member at Waco but escaped before the fire,'' the
letter read in part.
</P>
<P>
   The letter had an Asheville postmark and the author indicated
copies had been sent to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, ``60
Minutes'' and two North Carolina newspapers. WXII officials said
copies were turned over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A federal agent said the task force knows about the letter but
added: ``It ain't Eric Rudolph.
