 &HT;    Noisy truck could hold key to Rudolph case

   ANDREWS, N.C. _ An old pickup truck federal investigators
believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect
Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a ''few dozen miles'' over four days
before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head
of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts examined the engine and other parts trying to determine
a radius for the search for the fugitive, who may have used the
1977 Datsun truck to transport food and provisions to a hideout,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Woody Enderson appealed again Wednesday for help from
anyone who may have seen the blue truck between the night of July 9
and about noon July 13 when it was discovered. A note, believed to
have been written by Rudolph, was found inside with instructions to
return the truck to its owner, George Nordmann, 71, a health food
store owner who is an acquaintance of Rudolph's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have some information from witnesses that during
the time it was being driven by Eric Rudolph, the truck made a lot
of noise,'' Enderson said at a news conference. ''It is possible
that the truck may have been driven some distance out of the forest
area, and later back in again to where it was found. Again, the
truck did not run well but still may have put on as much as a few
dozen miles, so again we are asking anyone who may have seen or
heard that loud-sounding blue . . . truck, please contact us.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators continued searching Wednesday, the widow of
the police officer killed in the Birmingham bombing, and the host
and a crew for the ``America's Most Wanted'' television show flew
into town. Rudolph is a suspect in the Jan. 29 bombing of a
Birmingham abortion clinic that killed Robert Sanderson and injured
nurse Emily Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Felecia Sanderson said Wednesday she decided to come to the
North Carolina mountains to appear on ``America's Most Wanted''
after watching news reports in which some residents said they would
help Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people called him a folk hero,'' she said before being
interviewed by the show's host, John Walsh, for a segment that will
be broadcast Saturday. ``He's a murderer. He's a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring in the pressure of a prime-time TV
show,'' Walsh said. ``Someone may just see Eric Rudolph.'' Rudolph
has been a subject of several previous shows.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine briefing Wednesday, Enderson confirmed the
existence of a ''number of small campsites'' in the search area,
which has been focused around Nordmann's home, the campground where
the truck was found and the Rudolph family's former home, where he
spent most of his teenage years. All are in the Nantahala Forest,
and investigators have said their search area encompasses about 30
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one of those sites, we found trash buried in the ground,
and Eric Rudolph's fingerprint was identified on one of the pieces
of trash,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said the print was on a food wrapper
at a site they where Rudolph is believed to have perched to watch
Nordmann's house for several days before approaching Nordmann on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jack Thompson of Cherokee County, N.C., said Wednesday
that the campsites were in rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who else would be in the woods camping out in the
wilderness other than marijuana growers,'' Thompson said. ''He may
have a radio. He's got batteries, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   A million dollar reward is being offered for information leading
to Rudolph's arrest. The federal information hotlines are
1-800-575-9873 or 1-888-ATF-BOMB (283-2662).
</P>
<P>
   ''This remains a difficult and potentially dangerous day and
night search operation,'' Enderson said. ''We are still using every
means available, including canine, aerial and electronic methods.''
