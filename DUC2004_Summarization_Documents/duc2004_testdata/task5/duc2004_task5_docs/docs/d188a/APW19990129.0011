<HEADLINE> Cops: Clinic Bombing Done by Remote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Hoping to dispel the notion of Eric  
Rudolph as a noble outlaw, authorities said that one year ago 
Friday he waited outside an abortion clinic with a remote control 
and detonated a deadly bomb as two people drew near. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Rudolph used timers in three bombings in  
Atlanta, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one 
person. But Friday was the first time agents confirmed a remote 
control was used at New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham. 
The explosion killed an off-duty police officer and severely 
wounded a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric Rudolph is not a folk hero. He is a cold-blooded  
murderer,'' Police Chief Mike Coppage said at a news conference 
with federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph, a carpenter and a skilled mountaineer, disappeared  
after the Birmingham explosion on Jan. 29, 1998, and is believed to 
be hiding in the western North Carolina mountains, where he has 
taken on an almost mythic aura. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of the federal government  
run high in the area, and many locals have said they would help 
Rudolph if he came to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities released details of the bombing following a memorial  
service for Robert Sanderson, the police officer who worked at the 
clinic as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A trumpeter played ``Taps'' and a police honor guard laid a  
wreath of white flowers at a memorial honoring Sanderson and other 
officers killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurse Emily Lyons lost her left eye in the bombing and has  
undergone 13 operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson arrived to open the clinic shortly before Mrs. Lyons,  
investigators said. He approached the nail bomb, which sources have 
said was lying on the ground and disguised as a potted plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from a safe distance away, the bomber triggered the  
device as Sanderson stood over it, the officials said. Mrs. Lyons 
was hit with shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanderson was not just a bystander at an explosion meant to  
damage a building,'' U.S. Attorney Doug Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Cavanaugh, division director for the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said investigators used bomb fragments to 
determine the explosion was triggered by remote. He wouldn't 
comment on whether the control device has been located.
