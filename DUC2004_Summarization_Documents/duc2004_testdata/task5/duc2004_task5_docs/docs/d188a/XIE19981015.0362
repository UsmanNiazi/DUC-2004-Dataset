WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal authorities on
Wednesday charged Eric Robert Rudolph, one of the FBI's 10
most-wanted fugitives, with bombings including one blasted in
the Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics.

<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said the criminal complaint
charging Rudolph with the Olympic blast and the 1997 bombings of a
gay bar and an abortion clinic was being filed with a federal
court.

<P>
Reno said that Rudolph is on the run. But she said, "We are
going to keep searching until we find him and we're not going to
rest until we bring him to justice."
</P>

Louis Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), said Rudolph "now is charged with six bombings," including
three in Atlanta and the January 29 bombing of a Birmingham,
Alabama, abortion clinic.

<P>
Rudolph was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List last May, and
a one million U.S. dollars reward was offered based on earlier
charges that he bombed a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph was publicly linked to the Atlanta attacks last month
when it was learned a Tennessee gun dealer identified Rudolph as
the man who bought a special order of 50 pounds of smokeless
powder four years ago. Law enforcement official determined that
powder has been connected to the 1996 bombing at Centennial
Olympic Park.

<P>
The Olympic bombing killed one person and wounded more than 100
others. An off-duty policeman working as a guard was killed and a
nurse was injured in the Birmingham bombing.
