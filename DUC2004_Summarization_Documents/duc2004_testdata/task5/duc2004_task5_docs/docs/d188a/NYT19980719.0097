   Despite large law enforcement numbers, Rudolph still eludesBy

   More than 200 state, local and federal agents continued the
search in the mountains of western North Carolina for Eric Robert
Rudolph Sunday, but the 31-year-old suspect in the fatal Jan. 29
bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic continued to elude his
trackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be here until the end,'' Southeast Bomb Task
Force spokeswoman Celeste Armstead said. ``We'll be here until Eric
Robert Rudolph is captured.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, cars and trucks carrying heavily armed
federal agents, search dogs and equipment rolled out of a search
command post and staging area at a mountain campground east of
Andrews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rotate people to keep them fresh,'' Armstead said. ``We're
not cutting back. We're not scaling back at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some people's assertions that they would help Rudolph or
keep his whereabouts secret if they spotted him, federal officials
say they are getting good cooperation from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead would not, however, say whether agents are any closer
to capturing Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Also, areas near the search site are swamped with reporters but
not too many thrill seekers, as there isn't much a vacationer's
camera could capture from outside the search perimeter, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are keeping outsiders far from the 30 square-mile area
where trackers, dogs, helicopters and sophisticated surveillance
equipment are hunting for Rudolph, who is also sought for
questioning about three Atlanta explosions at Centennial Olympic
Park during the 1996 Olympics, a gay nightclub and a Sandy Springs
abortion clinic.
