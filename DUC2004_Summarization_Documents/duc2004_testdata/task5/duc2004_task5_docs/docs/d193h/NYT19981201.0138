SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR CHALKS UP TRAVEL MILES

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown has racked up more than
75,000 international travel miles in his three years in office,
perhaps more than any of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown on Tuesday began a three-day trade mission to Mexico, his
first excursion south of the border as mayor. He has made six
previous trips out of the country, traveling four times to Asia and
twice to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the mayor stopped in London, Paris and Frankfurt on
a mission to boost tourism.
</P>
<P>
   None of the trips has been at taxpayer expense because a fee,
paid by other travelers in his delegations, covers the mayor and
his City Hall staff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not the first mayor to globe-trot. Dianne Feinstein,
now the senior senator from California, traveled on several
occasions to Africa, Asia and Europe, said Hadley Roff, a deputy
mayor in the Feinstein administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she traveled four or five times to the Far East
because of sister city relationships,'' he said. ``China opened the
first American consulate in San Francisco and established direct
flights'' partly because of her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Roff said the late Joseph Alioto went to Mexico, and Frank
Jordan, who may challenge Brown in next year's mayoral race, made
two trips to Asia and one to Mexico during his four years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled only as issues presented themselves,'' Jordan said.
``I believe in international business. I went on trips when it was
beneficial to the city. There were no casual trips.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich DeLeon, a political science professor at San Francisco
State University, said it is Brown's job to maintain the city's
place as a world-class city by establishing relationships around
the world, particularly with Pacific-Rim countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling is a definite source of criticism, especially if he
doesn't explain it clearly to voters,'' DeLeon said. ``But the
mayor will have to deal with the local provincial bias. San
Francisco is way beyond potholes and lamp posts. It's concerned
about where it is in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few years, San Francisco will have more to do with Tokyo
and Seoul than it has with Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown defended his travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses and companies have benefited handsomely,'' he said.
``There's been more than $50 million in joint venture agreements,
airline routes, a Taipei port agreement and on and on.''
