CITY TURNS TO CONSULTANTS TO AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So many developers are so close to Mayor Willie
Brown that city officials are turning to outside consultants to
screen proposals for major real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
   The move, taken at the direction of the mayor's office, is aimed
at blunting charges of favoritism in the awarding of major
development deals.
</P>
<P>
   It could also deaden the punch of a potential campaign issue as
Brown look ahead to re-election: that his administration has been
awash in conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a prudent effort to inject more objectivity into
the process,'' said Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause,
a government watchdog group that has been critical of Brown's ties
with developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the face of it, it sounds like a good-faith effort,'' Knox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Redevelopment Commission, whose members are
appointed by the mayor, authorized Redevelopment Director James
Morales to hire an outside consultant to evaluate four bids for
redevelopment of the 500-acre Hunters Point Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the commission gave Morales approval to hire a
consultant to review four bids in a highly controversial sale of
property next to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for a hotel
and condominium development.
</P>
<P>
   But looking outside City Hall for expertise _ and for a shield
against charges of cronyism _ comes at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Morales estimates that each consulting contract will cost the
Redevelopment Agency tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs taxpayers money and, in an administration with
integrity, wouldn't be necessary,'' said state Sen. Quentin Kopp,
I-San Francisco, one of Brown's sharpest critics.
</P>
<P>
   From China Basin, where the San Francisco Giants are building a
new waterfront stadium, to downtown and Treasure Island, Brown's
friends, political associates and former law clients are either
doing or seeking major real estate deals with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the mayor say it's inevitable that someone like Brown,
so long in public life, would encounter his associates,
particularly in real estate boom times.
</P>
<P>
   But now the mayor's team is looking to put some distance between
City Hall and those relationships.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, for instance, when redevelopment officials opened
four bids from companies looking to manage development of the
Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, one of the proposals was from
Catellus Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Catellus had hired Brown as an attorney from 1982 to 1994 during
his tenure as speaker of the state Assembly. The company paid him
more than $140,000 in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Another bid came from Forest City Enterprises. Forest City
employs Brown political supporter Natalie Berg, the chairwoman of
the Democratic County Central Committee, which recently endorsed
the mayor for re-election _ 16 months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Catellus and Forest City are vying for the right to convert the
Hunters Point shipyard into a residential neighborhood and home to
commercial development and light industry.
</P>
<P>
   By using consultants, the Redevelopment Agency would turn over
its role as an evaluator of the proposals, according to Kofi
Bonner, the mayor's chief economic adviser.
