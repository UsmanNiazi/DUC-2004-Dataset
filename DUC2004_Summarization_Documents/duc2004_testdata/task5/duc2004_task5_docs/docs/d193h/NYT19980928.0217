<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown is getting decidedly mixed
reviews in his performance despite the city's generally healthy
economy, according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a year to go before he faces re-election, 41
percent of those surveyed said they approved of Brown's job
performance while just one in three would vote now to re-elect him
to a second term, according to the poll commissioned by the San
Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of those polled said they would consider a
rival candidate while 21 percent would vote to replace Brown if the
election were held now, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown apparently is hurt by troubles with the city's municipal
transit system, his handling of the city's homeless problem and a
perception that he is arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor gets praise for the city's strong economy, his
plans to develop Treasure Island and the vibrancy he brings to
public life, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   As he looks toward re-election in November 1999, the poll shows
59 percent of those surveyed believe San Francisco is headed in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed bag,'' said Del Ali of Mason-Dixon
Political/Media Research, which conducted the survey. ``He's lucky
there's not two parties in San Francisco. He's also lucky the other
(possible) challengers have high negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor gets higher favorable ratings than any of those
considered potential challengers, including state Sen. Quentin
Kopp, Board of Supervisors President Barbara Kaufman and former
political consultant Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, a spokesman for the mayor, played down Brown's
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Brown is much more highly visible because he's in the
news everyday and earns high visibility,'' said Bender, who is
traveling with the mayor in China. ``Who knows _ those numbers
could change.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 637 registered San Francisco voters was conducted
Sept. 23-24 by Mason-Dixon Political/Media research. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found 41 percent of those surveyed said Brown was doing
a good or excellent job, down from 46 percent in an Examiner poll
conducted last December. His job approval was 55 percent in a May
1997 poll, and 54 percent in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Bender defended the mayor by pointing to those who believe
the city is in good shape overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant finding of the poll was regardless of
(the transit system's) recent troubles and concerns about the
homeless, 60 percent of the city believes the city is headed in the
right direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicates extreme dissatisfaction with the mayor's
handling of the municipal transit system. Only 18 percent gave him
above-average grades for improving the Municipal Railway while 45
percent rated his performance as poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Muni was more of an issue, he'd be in a lot of trouble,''
Ali said. ``But he gets good ratings on the economy and jobs and
those are more important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 1995 election victory over incumbent Frank Jordan has
been credited, in part, for his criticism of the troubled transit
agency and his pledge to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of mayors who have lost re-election because of
poor city services is long,'' said Andrew Sullivan, co-founder of
the riders advocacy group Rescue Muni. ``I hope this mayor is aware
of that. They have a year to make improvements, and I hope they do,
not for the political implications, but because, as a Muni
customer, I want to see service improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown got strong ratings for improving the local economy and
handling Treasure Island's conversion from a military facility to
civil use.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 56 percent of those surveyed said he had
done a good or excellent job of improving the local economy and 42
percent approved of the way he began converting the former base at
Treasure Island to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was pleased his efforts to create jobs and preside
over a strong economy for longer-term economic health have been
acknowledged by San Franciscans,'' Bender said.
