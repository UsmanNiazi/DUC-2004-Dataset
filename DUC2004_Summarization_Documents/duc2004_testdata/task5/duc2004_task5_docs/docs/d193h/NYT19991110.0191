   SAN FRANCISCO _ Imagine if national politics were like politics
on Planet San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore would have gone to the Republican Party
for an endorsement, while former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
would have gone back to boring lectures about values.
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of what's happening here in the race for mayor, only
with two characters a lot more interesting than Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown, a Democrat who is the Great Satan for
California Republicans, went before members of the San Francisco
Republican Central Committee, asked for their endorsement in the
Dec. 14 run-off election, and got it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his opponent, Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano, introduced a resolution asking President Clinton to free
Leonard Peltier, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of
two FBI agents during a 1975 shootout on a reservation far from San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Ammiano pressing his attack on City Hall by coming
down four-square against the Pennsylvania execution of Mumia
Abu-Jamal, while Brown gets George W. Bush's endorsement?
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible Ammiano will play the Mumia card to solidify
his standing with the bumper sticker and bike messenger vote. But
Brown doesn't need Bush, and for that reason alone you can be sure
he wouldn't ask for his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's old Republican buddy, state Sen. Jim Brulte, made calls
to San Francisco Republicans on Brown's behalf. Brulte is a
co-chairman of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush probably doesn't even know who Brown is, given his
recent troubles naming leaders of foreign countries. Never mind
foreign planets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Virginia, Mississippi and Montana, there are Republicans on
Planet San Francisco. Like Republicans everywhere they don't agree
on everything. They used to agree on hating Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   No more, not with left-liberal Ammiano in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Faulkner, a former chairman of the Republican Central
Committee, is on the outs with the committee, and probably even
more so because he's one of the minority voting against endorsing
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Willie's world, it's all about buying and selling,''
Faulkner said when I asked him if maybe Brown was really a
Republican cleverly disguised in expensive clothes and hidden among
rich developer friends in ritzy Republican restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to get the W.E.B. Dubois Club endorsement in the old
days,'' Faulkner said. ``He'd get what he could from anyone. It
didn't matter to him. In those days, he was the darling of the
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we have another darling of the left, Ammiano, and maybe it's
understandable that he's shoring up his support with backers of
Peltier.
</P>
<P>
   In this town, you always have to worry about someone popping up
to the left of you, even if you're Ammiano, who regularly takes on
big business, the rich and the pope. Progressive elected officials
become members of the establishment faster than wet witches melt
down to their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That we know. But who would have predicted the sudden importance
of Republicans in San Francisco? About 15 percent of voters are
Republican, but Arthur Bruzzone, another former chairman of the
local Republican Party who voted to endorse Brown, thinks 30
percent of San Francisco voters are ``virtual Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruzzone says he saw a side of Brown that hasn't been seen much
in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Willie Brown I saw (Monday night) was the Willie Brown we
saw in state government, one more confident negotiating and dealing
with Republicans,'' Bruzzone said. ``He's probably going to be a
better mayor for his second term.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruzzone was awed by what took place when Brown came to
negotiate with the neglected Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it,'' Bruzzone said. ``I see
now why he became the most powerful person in California. Now I
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understand, too. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both have
rushed for the center, so why not Willie Brown? Pay no attention to
the weird gravity that seems to pull to the left, or the
hot-breath-rich atmosphere. This may not be Planet San Francisco,
after all.
