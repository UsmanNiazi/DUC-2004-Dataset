   SAN FRANCISCO _ Elinor Gatto, a lifelong San Franciscan,
considers Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. a sure-fire winner, and she
could hardly contain her excitement at having won him for part of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother of eight and the first-term mayor were slated to
have lunch on a recent afternoon _ her prize for the highest bid in
a parochial school auction. She called it her chance do good and
also to thank Brown for bringing style back to both the city and
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That he came out to the school really touched me,'' said
Brown, who was accompanied by her oldest grandchild. ``I just like
him. He's got style.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he gears up for next year's mayoral elections, Brown has
found that his colorful, press-the-flesh style may not as easily
satify other voters this time around. Although the election remains
his to lose, with supporters as well as many opponents predicting
victory, the adoration of the early days has waned even as San
Francisco continues to enjoy an unprecedented economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his impeccably tailored suits and brimmed hat, the
mayor was once hailed as a hero around San Francisco. As one of the
most powerful Democrats in the state, the former California
Assembly speaker still commands attention. President Clinton has
already given his endorsement. But recent polls find only about a
third of voters saying they expect to vote for him Nov. 2 _ half
the two-thirds support that swept him into office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not bet against Willie at this point just because his
ratings aren't as high as they were,'' said Bruce Cain, a political
science professor at the University of California in Berkeley.
``Willie will survive by keeping out a competitor, or at least
keeping out competitors on the left. . .But I don't think he's
taking anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Brown faces no formidable competition on either end of
the political spectrum. Only Clint Reilly, a real estate magnate
who made millions working as a Democratic political consultant,
even merits a mention from most political observers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the filing deadline is almost a month away, and any
number of name candidates could still emerge. The entrance of
openly gay Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, as expected
by some despite the Brown camp's claim that it has his word
otherwise, could siphon off votes and force an election runoff in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a candidate, or a potential candidate,
out there who can build the coalition Willie Brown has built,''
said Brown campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston. `` His politics and
personality fit with this city. . .But we have to remind our
supporters and instill in our volunteers that this is no
cakewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in no other major city would a mayor overseeing such
prosperity need even entertain uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brown took office in January 1996, unemployment has been
cut in half. Surging city revenues have transformed budget deficits
into surpluses. At $4.2 billion, his latest budget calls for more
than 1,000 new city jobs. Crime is down. Building is booming.
Property values are soaring. Public works projects include a
massive airport construction project.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco is no typical city. Socially liberal, more
conservative fiscally, with enough political factions to merit the
term Balkanized, residents tend to grumble about whoever is in the
mayor's office. They turned out each of Brown's last two
predecessors after one term.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are holding the current mayor accountable for not
solving the homeless problem or fixing the public transportation
system as he pledged to do in 100 days. Paul Boden, executive
director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness, estimated
that as many as 14,000 homeless people sleep on the city's streets
on any given night. Despite some improvement, the buses and trains
still do not run on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are disappointed in the mayor, especially in
regard to his ability to resolve some intractable problems,'' said
veteran pollster David Binder. ``They had their hopes raised that
Willie Brown being the consummate Sacramento politician with all
his power and trappings could be the one to bring real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Binder said that Brown's personality reflects
the city's: flashy, flamboyant, quick with a quip. He also called
the mayor uniquely suited to keep the peace among San Francisco's
inevitably warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, disputed that Brown has brought the city
together, saying he has made criminals of the homeless and pitted
the working class against the wealthy as housing prices rocket. The
man who ran the Assembly for 15 years has now turned City Hall into
his own personal fiefdom, they complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration carries a tremendous amount of clout, more
than anything I've ever seen,'' said Boden. ``At the same time, his
style of leadership is incredibly dysfunctional. Every city
department hates each other. There are power grabs and money
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Pier, Clint reilly's campain spokesman, ``This has
become Willie Brown's machine town. There is no organized
opposition to his tenure. He controls all of the institutions, all
of the money, all of the people, be it business or political. .
.Who else is going to try to take him down?''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, David Lee, executive director of the Chinese
American Voter Education Commission in San Francisco, said he would
have called the race a ``sweeper'' for Brown, who won with support
that cut across racial, ethnic and class lines. Now, with the
mayor's poll numbers so low, Lee is waiting to see what other
candidates jump into the race. Still, Brown's support among the
city's large Asian American community remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown has the power of incumbency, the greatest name
recognition,'' Lee said. ``Everyone knows him. They don't all like
him, but everyone knows him. Barring any major developments, he
should be able to sail in.''
