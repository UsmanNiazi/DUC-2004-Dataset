<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, who four years ago expressed
doubt about whether he could afford life on a City Hall salary,
reported personal income of $780,000 since taking office, his tax
returns show.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is running for re-election this year, also recorded
an apparent windfall in 1995 on the $3 million sale of a radio
station he co-owned, which netted the mayor $1 million, the returns
show.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor gave reporters one hour Wednesday to review four years
of federal income tax returns dating back to 1995. But he refused
to release copies and instead called on one of his re-election
challengers, Clint Reilly, to disclose several years of income tax
returns and tax filings by corporations and real estate
partnerships under Reilly's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is willing to throw open the door on his financial
records, but he does not want copies of his actual personal records
floating around,'' said P.J. Johnston, the Brown campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We challenge Mr. Reilly to do the same _ make available his
tax returns and financial holdings for the past eight years,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   A millionaire political consultant turned real estate investor,
Reilly was the first among the candidates for mayor to disclose his
income taxes. In April, he released copies of his 1998 federal tax
return.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's tax returns show that in 1998 he and his long-estranged
wife, Blanche, had an adjusted joint income of $329,080, and paid
$75,650 in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mayoral pay of $146,255.43, Brown also
reported income in 1998 stemming from his former law practice, a
government pension from his 30-year career as a state lawmaker and
from a stake he holds in an East Bay real estate agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1996, during his first two years as mayor, Brown
reported an adjusted gross income of $240,032 and $210,032,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reilly campaign spokesman Tom Pier said Brown was
only ``feigning to release his taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen minutes of study per year of taxes is inadequate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pier didn't say whether Reilly would make more of his tax
returns available, but said the onus falls heavier on someone, like
Brown, who has been in elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown has been representing the citizens of San
Francisco as mayor for the last four years and he has a duty to
fully disclose his income over that period,'' Pier said. ``Clint
Reilly has been a candidate for public office for one year and he
has released his taxes for that period.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Reilly released his 1998 federal tax return showing
an adjusted gross income of $700,934, including $57,780 earned by
his wife, Janet, who worked in public relations for a department
store chain. He paid $118,123 in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's tax return also contained financial information on
transactions that didn't all show up on his bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he reported receiving $2 million in rent from
commercial buildings in San Francisco and Sacramento. But, after
expenses and losses from other ventures were subtracted, his real
estate dealings added only $392,934 to his tax return.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Brown was weighing a run for mayor, he expressed
doubts about whether he could afford to hold the office _ which
forbids incumbents to engage in other occupations or business
activities.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, Brown combined his pay as Assembly speaker with
income from his San Francisco law practice, which paid him $1.15
million between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At a May 1995 luncheon in Sacramento, Brown said he was worried
about the effects that the salary cut that would go along with
being mayor would have on his wife and their three grown children,
to whom at the time he was lending at least some support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea of running for mayor. I love the idea of being
mayor of the City and County of San Francisco, but I have a serious
problem, a real serious problem,'' he said during the 1995
luncheon. ``If I could work out an income stream that would take
care of their obligations ... I will in an eye flash be a
candidate.''
