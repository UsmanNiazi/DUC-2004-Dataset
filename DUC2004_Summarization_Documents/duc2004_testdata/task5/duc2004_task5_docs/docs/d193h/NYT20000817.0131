   LOS ANGELES _ In his first year as the mayor of San Francisco,
Willie Brown stormed into the 1996 Democratic National Convention
in Chicago with the electricity of a Hollywood star.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a rousing five-minute speech praising President
Clinton's urban policy and blasting Republicans for neglecting
cities. As the crowd chanted, ``Willie, Willie,'' hundreds of ``Da
Mayor'' baseball hats were tossed into the California delegation.
</P>
<P>
   In his second-term, Brown is no less a party, but his presence
at this year's convention was decidedly low-key.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is one of the nation's most prominent mayors and a
leading black official, Brown did not speak from the convention
podium.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was offered a non-prime-time spot to address the
delegates. Brown declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first and foremost think you really ought to have a message
to deliver to the good and faithful from the podium,'' said Brown,
who has rarely been shy about sharing his messages. ``I don't need
to do that. My career in that regard is already done.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who was re-elected last year, explained that he would
have taken the role if he had been asked to speak about a
particular topic of concern to cities. And perhaps something other
than the 2:15 p.m. time slot he was offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a legitimate role for me on the rostrum, I'll be
happy to do that,'' he said. ``But just to put me up there to
settle some old bill is not necessary. For three minutes?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brown's colleagues were surprised he was not given a
more prominent role at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the former speaker of the California Assembly, he's the
mayor of San Francisco,'' said former state Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, who is now running for mayor of Los Angeles.
``I think that three minutes at 2:15 is not an appropriate
indication of his stature and his achievements for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is forbidden by city law from serving another term as
mayor, said his 36-year political career ``isn't even close to
being over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he did not have a prominent speaking role, Brown was
active at the convention, which concluded Thursday. He accepted
every chance to appear on national television. And while he skipped
the morning breakfasts with California delegates, he was a featured
speaker before the Massachusetts and South Carolina delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Brown insisted he was not avoiding the limelight. An early Gore
supporter, the mayor said he is doing much of his work for the vice
president behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a lower profile, it's a more practical way
for me to help,'' he said. For example, Gore aides have urged him
to do all the news internviews can. ``I'm being given the green
light to go do CNN and you and everybody else, all on message, and
I'm doing that. So I'm playing my role.''
