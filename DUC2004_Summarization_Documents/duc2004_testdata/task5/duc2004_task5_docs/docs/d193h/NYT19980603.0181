<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco voters rejected Mayor Willie
Brown's plans for the former naval base at Treasure Island and
public financing for his protocol office.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition K, which urges the Board of Supervisors to kill a
Brown-created development authority for Treasure Island, won with
56 percent of the vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition F, which would end public financing for the mayor's
protocol office and impose firm rules on how space in a refurbished
City Hall is used, was approved by 59 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both ballot measures were sponsored by state Sen. Quentin Kopp,
an Independent, and Clint Reilly, the political consultant turned
real estate investor who is considering a bid for mayor in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Treasure Island power grab by the mayor was seen
through by the voters,'' Reilly said. ``It ought to be a signal to
voters who are disenchanted with city management by the mayor that
they have ways to make their disenchantment heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kopp: ``Both measures represent voters' dismay at the
mayor's overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said voters had never been told the whole story about the
measures' contents and that it would be a mistake to draw any
conclusions about the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures are as well-disguised as was Prop. 209,'' Brown
said, referring to the 1996 state ballot measure that ended
affirmative action in government contracting and school admissions.
``Many people who voted for 209 said, `I didn't mean that. I didn't
mean to block kids from going to the University of California.'''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Proposition F, the mayor said, ``I'm sure there'll
be many people, if it goes badly, who will say, `I didn't intend to
keep child care centers out of City Hall. I didn't intend to block
handicapped access to City Hall. No, that was not my intention. My
intention was to keep it from being a party palace.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not a party palace, it's what the liars of the
world call a party palace.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brown ran for mayor in 1995, he said he would build a Monte
Carlo-style casino on Treasure Island after the Navy left. He
backed away from the statement days later, but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of City Hall, the mayor originally said he wanted to
bring hundreds fewer city workers back to the building after the
restoration, to leave more space for celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Board of Supervisors, objecting to extra rent the
city would pay to house displaced workers, nixed the plan. Brown
backed away from it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition K calls for repeal of the Treasure Island
Development Authority, a nonprofit entity incorporated by the mayor
and governed by his appointees, which has the power to make
redevelopment decisions for the former Navy base.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure was put on the ballot as a policy statement and
requires the supervisors to pass an ordinance to give it the force
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors President Barbara Kaufman said the
Brown-created authority was a logical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a hard time voting to repeal it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition F, however, is an ordinance that binds the board and
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for an end to the use of tax dollars to pay for
party-throwing, gift-giving and other activities of the mayor's
protocol office.
