   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one denies Mayor Willie Brown Jr.'s ability
to stir an audience. The other day he spoke at the 20th-anniversary
commemoration of the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and City
Supervisor Harvey Milk, and his simple words on this ``tragedy of
tragedies'' brought louder applause than the star attraction, Joan
Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows how to make people laugh, too. Always impeccably
dressed in one of his classic $3,000 Brioni suits, he wisecracks,
makes goofy faces and generally hams it up at every festival,
groundbreaking and public announcement, instilling in spectators
the disarming effect of watching the coolest kid in class become
the class clown. In fact, voters in a recent poll said his charisma
was his greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years, those voters seem tired of a mayor most
notable for talking a crowd into his vest pocket. For all his
charm, Brown, a Democrat who is one of only two or three mayors in
the country with widespread name recognition, is in trouble. The
man whose political clout and social savvy single-handedly put San
Francisco back on the national political map is getting his worst
approval ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of every 10 voters surveyed in a recent poll by The
San Francisco Chronicle said they were inclined to back him for a
second term. That amounts to a radical decline for a mayor who
breezed into office with the support of two-thirds of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   And for a master politician with 34 years in public office _ 15
of them as Assembly speaker, holder of the second-most-important
elective office in the nation's most populous state _ the low
approval ratings are especially perplexing now. This, after all, is
an ideal time to be a mayor, when mayors all over the country are
riding high, taking and getting credit for national trends like
falling crime rates, low unemployment and sound fiscal health. And
Brown's San Francisco fits all those patterns: Crime and
unemployment are down, and the city's budget, which showed a $65
million deficit when he took office, now has a projected surplus of
$145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, San Franciscans are obviously upset. They are upset, the
poll found, with Brown's seeming inability to make the buses and
trains run on time or to get the homeless off the streets. And they
are upset at downtown traffic jams, a lack of public parking,
litter, mediocre schools and the mayor's ``arrogance.'' In short,
they are upset at a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, who left the Assembly (where he nicknamed himself the
Ayatollah) only after term limits had forced him out, the nearly
unthinkable is happening: the looming possibility of life as a
civilian. Politicians presumed dead, like Brown's predecessor,
Frank Jordan, are resurrecting themselves, talking of a possible
challenge in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After a first year in which he all but walked on water, there
was really nowhere for Brown to go but down. But just why he is so
far down depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press secretary, Kandace Bender, says the latest
poll was worded so that the responses specifically regarding him
would be negative. ``I think the important figure to remember is
that 56 percent of the voters approve of the direction the city is
going,'' she said. ``Three years ago that figure was 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are inclined to say that the very qualities that
enthralled voters in the first place, Brown's glamour and glitz,
have begun to grate on a city where homelessness is so prevalent
and two-thirds of the residents are renters who may never be able
to afford to buy in San Francisco's exorbitant housing market.
(Some people are still smarting over the lavish parties, closed to
the public, that the mayor gave when the city was host to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who are disenchanted with the machine-style
politics Brown brought with him from the Assembly, where back-room
wheeling and dealing was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've realized since Brown is that the supervisors
are irrelevant,'' said Ted Gullicksen, manager of the San Francisco
Tenants Union, which won a ballot measure in the election on Nov. 3
that helped protect tenants from evictions. Brown had endorsed the
ballot measure and asked the Board of Supervisors to resurrect 1996
legislation that would further strengthen tenants' protections, but
Gullicksen said the mayor had simply been trying to bolster his
position for his coming election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown made his reputation as someone who plays hardball
politics,'' Gullicksen said. ``His No. 1 goal is keeping himself in
office, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. If there
was another progressive candidate on the horizon, we would endorse
them over Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is never easy being mayor of San Francisco. Each
of Brown's immediate two predecessors survived only one term. The
people of this city are so politically active that the free
weeklies run listings of coming protests. It is probably safe to
say that if Brown had declared war on the kind of quality-of-life
irritations to which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani devoted so much energy
in New York, the squeegee men, the strip clubs and the panhandlers
would not have gone quietly. Indeed, not long after he had
announced aggressive moves to clear encampments put up by the
homeless, protesters bombarded Brown with three pies in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most politically active city in the
country,'' said Phillip Matier, a political columnist for The San
Francisco Chronicle. ``It's a very expensive place to live, and
people want to believe they're getting their money's worth. You
also have all these competing interests all the time. It's not an
accident that so many of the state's high offices are occupied by
San Franciscans: This city is very tough on politicians, and only
the strongest survive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the mayor should manage to weather the political
doldrums. Willie Lewis Brown Jr., born dirt-poor in segregated
Mineola, Texas, in 1934, was Slick Willie long before anyone had
even heard of Bill Clinton. He has, for example, managed to duck
many accusations over the years that he rewards political friends
with important contracts and development deals.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges of patronage and cronyism have followed him back
to San Francisco: Just recently a mayoral committee looking over
proposals for the redevelopment of a former naval base marina
called Treasure Island recommended that the deal go to a group of
investors with close political ties to the mayor, in an arrangement
that critics say would net the city far less money than other
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor shrugs off the accusations of cronyism, saying that
after 34 years in government, there are few people he does not
know.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating criticism over the homeless and the city's bus and
rail system, called MUNI, Brown devoted over half of his
state-of-the-city speech last month to those two issues, explaining
what he had tried to do and what he would do in the coming year.
Ms. Bender, his press secretary, said the voters' view of how he
handles MUNI would change when they became aware of what he was
doing to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've ordered about 280 new buses, 250 new electric trolleys
and 136 light rail vehicles,'' she said. ``We've slotted $23
million over last year's base-line budget for MUNI. We've cleared
all of the backlog of customer complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the mayor has reduced crime in the
system, ordered that tracks on the rail line be replaced and
shortened commuting time by assigning traffic officers to make sure
buses can pass through intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all that,'' she said, ``if you ask voters, `Do you
approve or disapprove of what the mayor has done with MUNI,' what
do you think the answer will be?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bender said the mayor was also working on homelessness,
although the city strongly disputes figures, from advocates for the
homeless, showing 16,000 people on the streets. ``Our figures are
between 4,000 and 6,000,'' Ms. Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the mayor denies that he is worried about his poll
numbers. His position, political observers say, is strengthened by
the fact that no one on the progressive end of the city's political
spectrum _ which runs from the moderately liberal Democratic to the
very liberal _ has stepped forward to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for someone to be very threatened, they have to face
challenges from the left and right,'' said Matier, the Chronicle
columnist. ``That hasn't happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   By Brown's account, the reason is that he is one of a kind.
``There's never been a mayor who opens up City Hall on Saturdays
and gives everyone 10 minutes,'' he said at a recent press
briefing, adding that his phone number was still listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for anybody who suddenly decides he's
going to take Willie Brown out,'' he said. ``I really work at this
job. Every day of my life I work at this job. No one is going to be
as prepared as I am.''
