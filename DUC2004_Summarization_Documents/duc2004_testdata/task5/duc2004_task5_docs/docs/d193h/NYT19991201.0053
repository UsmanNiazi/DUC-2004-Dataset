 CLINTON COLLECTS HALF-MILLION IN S.F. _ AND BOOSTS MAYOR  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton made a pit stop in San
Francisco Tuesday, picking up $500,000 in contributions for the
Democratic battles ahead and using the opportunity to cheer on
embattled Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle,
the president stopped for a luncheon with 50 guests at the Pacific
Heights home of venture capitalist Bill Hambrecht and his wife,
Sally, where attendees paid $5,000 to $20,000 to eat dim sum before
a stunning panoramic view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was a fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and was attended by leading Democrats, including
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt; Senator Barbara Boxer, San
Francisco Bay Area Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Ellen Tauscher and
Lynn Woolsey; and California Democratic Party Chair Art Torres.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks to go before his runoff election, the fate of
Brown was clearly Topic A among the deep-pocketed Democratic
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ long a star attraction at such big-ticket party
fund-raisers _ has touted his close relationships with Clinton,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
Democratic Governor Gray Davis. But now Brown finds himself in an
unexpectedly tough re-election battle against Supervisor Tom
Ammiano, a fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi subtly acknowledged the mayor's troubles when she
addressed Clinton and introduced him to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, no matter what you've heard, (Brown is) our
great, present and  &UR; future  &LR; mayor of San Francisco,'' she said to
warm applause.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has clearly taken an interest in Brown's
predicament. As Clinton disembarked from Air Force One at San
Francisco International Airport, presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart asked a reporter about the most recent polls on the
mayoral runoff. But he didn't know the name of Brown's challenger.
``Who is he again?'' Lockhart asked.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's fund-raiser in the Hambrecht home, Brown appeared
the very image of the connected Democrat. He hunkered down with
Clinton, delivering an animated and apparently side-splitting
update on his current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton _ who recorded radio commercials and
telephone voice messages on Brown's behalf during the general
election in November _ never explicitly endorsed the mayor or
appealed for votes for him.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded Democrats of the administration's record on
education, parental leave and other issues, and praised Pelosi and
Gephardt for spearheading a campaign to win back the House
leadership for the Democrats in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting 50 seats around the country, at least six of
them in California,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also pointedly reminded Democratic loyalists that
San Francisco _ and, by inference, Brown himself _ has supported
his administration in critical fights with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so indebted to California. San Francisco has been so good
to me and Hillary, the vice president and Mrs. Gore,'' he told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And he underscored his longtime and occasionally teasing
friendship with Brown before a sympathetic audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from Willie Brown,'' Clinton said,
gesturing to the mayor, who stood by in a resplendent steel-gray
suit. ``I've learned to dress better.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton laughed aloud. ``I never thought I'd live long
enough to see him in a race where somebody is running to the left
of him,'' he said, as Brown grinned. ``I don't know if there's any
oxygen left over there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, Clinton added, ``I'm still learning from
you. And I thank you, Mr. Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's kind words for Brown may carry some weight.
Polls show that California voters still overwhelmingly approve of
Clinton's job performance, even though they don't like him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments about Brown were repeated by Torres, the state
Democratic Party chairman, who left no doubt as to where his
support lies in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's doing great. It's all going to come down to
getting out the vote. And that's what we're going to do,'' said
Torres, adding that absentee ballots and precinct walking will be
crucial among key voter groups like African Americans, Asians and
Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   And while some have criticized Brown for frequenting such
high-priced fund-raisers, Torres argued that the mayor's political
relationships have worked to the advantage of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (his connections) are very important in terms of what
the mayor's been able to bring to the city,'' he said. ``That
depends on the relationships he's made over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving San Francisco, Clinton flew to Los Angeles, where
he called on Congress to extend the current background checks on
prospective gun buyers, to ban violent juvenile offenders from
possessing guns when they turn 21, to require child safety locks on
every handgun and to prohibit the importation of high-capacity
ammunition clips.
