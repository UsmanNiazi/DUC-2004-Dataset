CARACAS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hugo Chavez was elected Sunday
Venezuela's president for the next five years from 1999 to 2004,
according to the first official bulletin released by the National
Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
Of 76.12 percent of the counted votes, Hugo Chavez won 2.87
million, representing 56.34 percent of the counted votes,
as compared to 2.02 million, or 39.59 percent, for Henrique Salas, his
close challenger.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Chavez, 44, graduated from Venezuela's Military Academy in
1975. He was appointed commander of an elite paratrooper unit
after being working in the presidential palace to help guard then
President Carlos Andres Perez.
</P>
<P>
"Today a new Venezuela is being born," Chavez, who will be
sworn in on February 2, 1999, said in his first TV interview,
calling for unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He also called on foreign investors to have confidence in his
future government.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the world's largest oil producer outside the
Middle East and the second largest oil supplier to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic slump has attacked the oil-rich country.
Venezuela has foreseen an oil income of 19 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, but it finally settles at 12 billion dollars, due to lower
crude prices.
