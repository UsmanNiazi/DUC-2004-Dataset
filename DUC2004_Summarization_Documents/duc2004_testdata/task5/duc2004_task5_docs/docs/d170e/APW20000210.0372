<HEADLINE> Former Chavez Ally: Govt. Is Corrupt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A growing division in President Hugo Chavez's
political coalition deepened Thursday when a fellow former coup leader charged
that Chavez's first year in government has been marked by corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Lt. Col. Jesus Urdaneta, who resigned recently as the head of the
political police, delivered evidence to the national prosecutor's office of what
he said were 46 cases of corruption he uncovered in the last year.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations were the latest attack against Chavez and his inner circle
by three of the former officers who helped him stage the failed 1992 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The three charge that Chavez's so-called ``peaceful revolution'' -- a
radical reform program whose professed goal is to clean up rampant corruption in
the oil-rich South American nation -- is losing direction.
</P>
<P>
	   But some analysts also think the feud is part of a power struggle, since the
fellow coup leaders may feel sidelined now that Chavez is president.
</P>
<P>
	   Urdaneta said he advised Chavez of most of the allegations during the last
year. He charged that he was forced out of his post three weeks ago because
Chavez wanted the investigations stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have been firing accusations at one another for the last week,
raising the specter of a major division in Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole
coalition.
