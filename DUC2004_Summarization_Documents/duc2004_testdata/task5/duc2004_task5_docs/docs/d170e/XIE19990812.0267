<HEADLINE> Chavez Sworn in Again As Venezuelan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
who symbolically resigned last week, on Wednesday was sworn in as
president before the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA).
</P>
<P>
Chavez, elected in the December presidential elections,
testified as president for the first time on February 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Chavez offered his resignation to the NCA and
called on the NCA to rewrite the country's present constitution,
which has been in effect since 1961. But his resignation was
rejected by the NCA, controlled by Chavez's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Among his proposals for a new constitution, Chavez called on
the NCA to extend the presidential term from five years to six
years and to allow all incumbents to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
But Chavez's bid to rewrite the 1961 national charter was
strongly opposed by the Supreme Court and Congress, both
controlled by opposition parties.
