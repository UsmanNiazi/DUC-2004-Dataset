   CARACAS, Venezuela _ One of the newest government office
buildings in Caracas is the marbled-sided Ministry of Finance.
Walking through the lobby there the other day I noticed that the
huge clock overlooking the reception desk was either (a) broken or
(b) 20 minutes slow. I didn't stay long enough to see which. But I
did stay in Venezuela long enough to realize that many people were
asking the same thing about President Hugo Chavez's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Is it broken? Or is it just a little late in blooming? Is he
leading Venezuela in a transition, the exact direction of which
will emerge after the May 28 presidential elections, or is he
leading Venezuela into a dead end?
</P>
<P>
   Who is Hugo Chavez? You hear that a lot here, and not just from
the corrupt politicians who ruled Venezuela for four decades before
the populist Chavez ousted them in a vote last year that amounted
to an electoral revolution. With unemployment here at 20 percent,
and with the economy having shrunk by 7.2 percent last year, even
some of the poor have turned against Chavez with graffiti: ``He
feeds us rhetoric to fill our minds, but our stomachs are empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best description of Chavez was from a diplomat here
who said: ``Hugo Chavez is a work in progress _ and a piece of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hugo Chavez who is a piece of work is the Chavez who ordered
U.S. military ships steaming to Venezuela _ on an emergency aid
mission to rebuild the vital coastal highway destroyed by mudslides
_ to go away. Chavez, a former army colonel and pal of Fidel
Castro, didn't want to look too dependent on the U.S. He recently
described Castro's medical-welfare system as a ``sea of happiness''
_ ignoring how many Cubans were risking their lives to swim away
from that sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hugo Chavez who is a work in progress is equally
interesting. Venezuela's political system needed a radical
overhaul, and Chavez is doing that. But so far his biggest reform
has been to rewrite the Constitution to widen his powers and
lengthen his potential time in office.
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez is re-elected in May _ he is being challenged by
Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former comrade who has charged Chavez
with incompetence _ the big question is, what will he build on his
new foundation, and with whom? Frankly, his team has a certain
Keystone Kops, not-ready-for-prime-time quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is obvious. Venezuela is a country that has been
cursed with oil. The reigning assumption in this nation, which sits
atop some of the world's richest fields, has been that Venezuela is
naturally rich and if it is getting poorer it is because someone in
power is stealing. So politics has tended to be about whom to
lynch, not what to build. The truth is, though, that with 85
percent of its foreign currency coming from oil sales, Venezuela is
a country that has forgotten how to create wealth. It only knows
how to distribute it. First the oligarchs distributed it to their
cronies. Now Chavez wants to give more to the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't enough oil money anymore, and Chavez has not
detailed any credible plan for creating new wealth _ by attracting
non-energy-related foreign investment and building globally
competitive companies _ so that one-fifth of the country doesn't
have to work for the government. Today, the biggest export of
Venezuela's private sector is itself; the managers and scientists
who have global skills are leaving, frightened by the rising crime
wave and the Chavez populism that suggests that anyone here who has
money must have stolen it.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Chavez ran for office as Robin Hood in a country that needs
Bill Gates _ someone who not only redistributes wealth but knows
how to create it. Chavez came into office with a deep suspicion of
globalization. But on his recent trip to Beijing it was the Chinese
who told him to pay more attention to developing a globally
competitive private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez deserves a chance to prove himself as something more than
Robin Hood. If he can use his credibility with Venezuela's
underclass to lead them to a more modern economy, he will become
one of the most important figures in Latin America. If he doesn't,
Venezuela, which is America's largest supplier of oil, is going to
witness some really explosive and destabilizing politics.
</P>
<P>
   Time is short, and, somewhere at least, a clock is ticking.
