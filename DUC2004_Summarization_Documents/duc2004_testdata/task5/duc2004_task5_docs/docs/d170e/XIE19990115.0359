WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will meet Venezuela's president-elect Hugo Chavez, a former
paratrooper who was denied a U.S. visa in 1998 for leading a
bloody coup attempt in 1992.

"We offered him a meeting at the White House and he accepted,"
a spokesman for Clinton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will meet with White House National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger and Clinton will join the meeting later, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will take office on February 2. His country is the
United States' main oil supplier along with Saudi Arabia.
</P>

Chavez's nationalist electoral platform worried foreign
investors and the United States. But after his landslide victory
in December, the U.S. government said it would welcome a visit by
Chavez to Washington.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs
Peter Romero flew to Caracas two weeks ago and met Chavez. The
official said Washington would support Chavez as long as he stuck
to Venezuela's constitution.
