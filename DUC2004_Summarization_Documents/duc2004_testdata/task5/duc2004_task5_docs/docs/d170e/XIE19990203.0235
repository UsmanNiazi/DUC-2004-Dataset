<HEADLINE> Hugo Chavez Sworn in As Venezuelan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Hugo Chavez, the former army
officer who led an abortive coup in 1992, was sworn in as
Venezuelan president on Tuesday, promising to revamp Venezuela's
political system and boost its lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
"I swear in front of God, my country and my people on this
dying constitution that I will push forward the democratic
revolution so that the republic will have a Magna Carta adequate
for a new day," Chavez said as his supporters burst into cheers.
</P>
<P>
Chavez won a landslide victory on December 6, largely by
capitalizing on Venezuelans' anger over rampant corruption and
decades of declining living standards in the south American nation,
which has the largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Chavez becomes Venezuela's youngest president.
He takes over from 83-year-old Rafael Caldera.
</P>
<P>
In his two-hour inaugural speech, Chavez said that he would
immediately sign an order for a referendum on constitutional
reforms. He is seeking a "constituent assembly" that would
radically amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also declared a "war on misery", saying that a country like
Venezuela with 80 percent of its 23 million population in poverty
was "shameful". In this respect, he said that he would introduce a
bill in Congress asking for special powers to push through
economic reforms, stressing that he was inheriting an economic "
time bomb".
</P>
<P>
Chavez has made the transformation of Venezuela's inefficient
political institutions the core of his ambitious program, pledging
to redistribute oil wealth and root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Attending Tuesday's ceremony were Argentine President Carlos
Menem, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Spain's Prince
Felipe. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was also present at
the inauguration ceremony.
