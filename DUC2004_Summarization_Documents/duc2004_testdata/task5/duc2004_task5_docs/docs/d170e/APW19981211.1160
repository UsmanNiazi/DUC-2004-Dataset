Hugo Chavez says his coup attempt was legitimate

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez said
Friday his 1992 attempt to overthrow the government was ``without a
doubt legitimate.''
	   ``Here we are standing tall, all of us vindicated,'' Chavez
declared in a speech at the National Electoral Council after he was
officially declared president-elect.
	   Chavez won the presidency by a landslide last Sunday. His
Patriotic Pole coalition, which includes many people who helped
Chavez stage his coup attempt, won a plurality of Congress in
regional elections last month.
	   The elections were a devastating blow to the political and
economic establishment that has ruled Venezuela during 40 years of
democracy. Chavez, the first person from outside the old-style
party elite to become president, rode a wave of public anger over
poverty and corruption.
	   ``A people with hunger does not live in democracy,'' he said,
defending his attempted coup.
	   He offered few details about what he plans to do as president,
except to say he will hold a national referendum in February to
install a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.
	   After his speech at the electoral council, he walked outside and
gave another speech to thousands of cheering supporters. Earlier,
he laid a wreath at the tomb of Simon Bolivar, the South American
liberation hero.
	   Chavez will take office Feb. 2 for a five-year term. He replaces
82-year-old President Rafael Caldera, who released Chavez from
prison in 1994.
