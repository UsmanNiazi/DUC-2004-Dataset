   CARACAS, Venezuela _ He hasn't receive a single vote, but
leading Venezuelan presidential candidate Hugo Chavez has already
tested his political coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chavez's father, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, was
elected governor of western Barinas state. A 65-year-old retired
schoolteacher, the elder Chavez had never before held elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He capitalized on the Chavez phenomenon,'' said Jose
Machillanda, a retired Venezuelan army colonel who runs a research
center in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates running under Hugo Chavez's Patriotic Pole, a
coalition of 13 leftist and nationalist parties, won eight of 23
governorships and about one-third of the seats in the Venezuelan
house and senate in Nov. 8 regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although that would leave Hugo Chavez with a divided legislature
should he win Sunday's presidential election, his movement
out-polled Venezuela's traditional political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, like his son Hugo _ the second of six
sons _ describes himself as an outsider. He said his experience
includes teaching school for 40 years as well as grass-roots work
in political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea (to run for governor) came from the people, and I
accepted,'' said the elder Chavez, who wore a baseball cap
embroidered with his son's name. ``We have a realistic project to
improve education and health care and to create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Hugo de los Reyes Chavez as a regional
powerbroker could force his son to reconsider some of his proposed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Chavez has promised to convoke a special assembly to
rewrite the Venezuelan constitution. Sweeping changes could include
everything from scrapping the congress and the courts to remaking
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez has said that the assembly would have the power to
dissolve the legislative assemblies of the states and to redefine
the roles of the governors,'' said a Caracas businessman who didn't
want his name printed.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen, he said, the newly elected governors _
including Chavez's father _ ``are basically not going to be in
power very long.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that scenario, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez shook
his head, saying he trusts his son to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even being considered,'' he said. &QL;
