<TEXT>

CARACAS, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Venezuelan president-elect Hugo
Chavez announced on Monday that several foreign states have
recognized his triumph in Sunday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I have received phone calls from Argentine President Carlos
Menem and from the White House," Chavez said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was one of the first to recognize Chavez's
victory in the election.
</P>
<P>
After preliminary results revealed that Chavez, 44, had
defeated his rival Henrique Salas Romer, U.S. ambassador John
Maisto met with leaders of the Movement To Socialism, one of the
parties making up Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole.
</P>
<P>
Maisto said his government would back the winner of the
presidential election, whoever he was.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States denied Chavez a tourist visa
because he had headed a coup attempt against then President Carlos
Andres Perez in 1992.
