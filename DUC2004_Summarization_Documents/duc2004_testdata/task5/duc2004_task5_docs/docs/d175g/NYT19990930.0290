GUENTER GRASS, GERMANY'S POSTWAR CONSCIENCE, WINS NOBEL PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

   BERLIN _ Guenter Grass, whose epic first novel, ``The Tin
Drum,'' first tackled the theme of Germany's agonized identity,
which he has examined from various angles throughout his life, was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday by the Swedish
Academy in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Uncompromising in his political stances, often headily evocative
in his rhythmic prose, Grass, 71, has probed the development of
Germany from Nazism through Cold-War division to unification with a
relentlessly vivid eye. He became the first German to receive the
prize since Heinrich Boell in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy said Grass'
``frolicsome black fables portray the forgotten face of history.''
It praised his gift for ``reviewing contemporary history by
recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: the victims, losers and
lies that people wanted to forget because they had once believed in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the 20th century's fictional characters, perhaps few are
as memorable as Oskar Matzerath, the boy with the tin drum and
glass-shattering voice who stopped growing and so passes largely
unnoticed as he observes the horror of the Nazi years with an
unwavering gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entire credulous nation believed, there's faith for you, in
Santa Claus. But Santa Claus was really the gasman,'' Oskar
observes in ``The Tin Drum'' as he contemplates Germany's pious
infatuation with Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The raw power of such writing propelled the book, published in
1959, to worldwide fame and helped revive German literature after
what the Swedish Academy called ``decades of linguistic and moral
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass was en route to the dentist Thursday in Luebeck, his
hometown in northern Germany, when informed of the prize. Later, he
said, ``It's a great joy for me, not just for myself but for all
German literature, which is honored with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncharacteristically patriotic remark from a man who
was bitterly critical of German unification in 1990, describing it
as another Anschluss and insisting that Auschwitz should have made
a united Germany forever impossible because it demonstrated that
such a country was a danger to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Solidly built, his face dominated by mischievous eyes and a
drooping walruslike mustache, Grass has never shied away from
challenging what he has often seen as his country's bourgeois
complacency.
</P>
<P>
   He explored his anger, and angered many of his countrymen, in
his major novel of the 1990s, ``Ein Weites Feld.'' Published in
1995 and translated as ``A Broad Field,'' the book was widely
criticized in Germany for its portrayal of ignorant and avaricious
business tycoons taking over the ``people's property'' of the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the work, whatever the criticism, captured the mutual
incomprehension that had plagued Germany's attempts at integration
throughout the 1990s, and the academy said that it confirmed ``the
author's position as the great prober of the history of this
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass, whose passionate engagement in German society is utterly
removed from the minimalist introspection of some modern
literature, said Thursday: ``A writer must not only fulfill
literary obligations, but also those of a citizen by being involved
politically. I hope that young writers remember this in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The admonition came from a man who has repeatedly found
inspiration in the turbulence and tragedy of 20th-century German
life. Among Grass' best-known books, all published in the United
States, are ``Cat and Mouse'' (1961) and ``Dog Years''(1963), which
with ``The Tin Drum'' make up the ``Danzig Trilogy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 came ``The Flounder,'' a bustling and mischievous yarn
woven from world history in which the destructiveness of men is
contrasted with the achievements and sanity of women. This year
Grass published ``My Century: A Novel of Stories,'' which is a
running commentary on his times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prize was long overdue,'' said Martin Walser, a prominent
German writer. ``Grass deserved to win the Nobel Prize for `The Tin
Drum' alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last year Walser said that he was impatient with
constant reminders of the Holocaust, remarks that prompted debate
in Germany and revealed the uneasy conscience and uncertain
national identity so often examined by Grass.

<P>
   Born Oct. 16, 1927, in Danzig, now Gdansk, Poland, Grass saw the
rise of Nazism as a child and was drafted into the army in 1944. He
narrowly escaped death when many 17-year-old members of his company
were ripped to shreds by shelling. Later, when Germany surrendered,
he was captured by the U.S. Army and briefly held.
</P>
<P>
   Grass worked on a farm, in a mine and as an apprentice
stonemason before studying sculpture and beginning to write poems
and plays in the 1950s. He also worked as a journalist and
illustrated some of his books. A first marriage to a Swiss dancer,
Anna Margareta, ended in divorce after the birth of four children;
Grass married Ute Grunert in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was indelibly influenced by his youth, which was shaped by
war, the loss of a home that disappeared into Poland and
involvement with a Nazi convulsion for which he was too young to
bear any responsibility but whose guilt he could not escape. He was
just too old for what Helmut Kohl, born in 1930, later called ``the
blessing of late birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass turned his wounds into powerful literary and political
expression. With a handful of other writers, including Boell and
Hans Magnus Enzensberger, he fought relentlessly after the war
against German amnesia, what Enzensberger once called the ``nice
contented grave'' of the postwar economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this context of postwar authoritarianism, of an
American-assisted German reconstruction so successful that it
served to blanket memory of past crimes, that ``The Tin Drum''
burst upon the national consciousness with all the power of a
thunderbolt.
</P>
<P>
   Grass did not hesitate to remind his compatriots of precisely
the history from which they had emerged. Gdansk might be in
Communist Poland, conveniently behind the Iron Curtain, but little
Oskar had seen what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, the author mocked Germans looking for Poland with
``Leicas and compasses, with radar, divining rods, delegations and
moth-eaten provincial students' associations in costume.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``One of these days they will go searching for
Poland with rockets. I, meanwhile, conjure up Poland on my drum.
And this is what I drum: Poland's lost, but not forever, all is
lost, but not forever, Poland's not lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, as it happened, was Germany's Nazi past, the thugs whom
Oskar observes after they have ransacked the toy shop of Sigismund
Markus, a Jewish merchant in Danzig: ``One had drawn his dagger. He
was cutting dolls open and he seemed disappointed each time that
nothing but sawdust flowed from their limbs and bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, under the moral suasion of writers like Grass and
the protests of the postwar generation, this history returned to
form a central part of Germany's modern consciousness, a reference
point and a warning to which the country is now painfully vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   The language of Grass was so pungent, even overwhelming at
times, that it left Germans with no escape from the world it
evoked. Reviewing ``The Tin Drum'' in The New York Times Book
Review, Frederic Morton commented: ``The Bruegel landscape suddenly
swarms with the consummate monsters of Hieronymus Bosch.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass has never been entirely satisfied that the monsters are
tamed. Through his writing and political stands, he has always
attacked any indications of re-emergent German satisfaction or
smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Always a man of the left, although his relations with the Social
Democratic Party have been stormy, Grass has repeatedly criticized
what he once described as the ``closet racism'' of Germans,
evident, he argued in 1997, in their attitude toward the country's
large Turkish population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Social Democrat because socialism without democracy is
worthless to me and because an unsocial democracy is no
democracy,'' Grass once said. He later left the party, and has been
critical of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's attempts to shift Social
Democracy toward a more pro-business stance.
</P>
<P>
   Grass became the fifth successive European to receive the prize
after Jose Saramago of Portugal in 1998, Dario Fo of Italy in 1997,
Wislawa Szymborska of Poland in 1996 and Seamus Heaney of Ireland
in 1995. From 1929 to 1998 the prize had been bestowed upon only
two German authors, Thomas Mann and Boell. The Nobel Prize is worth
about $1 million and is to be presented to Grass at a ceremony in
Stockholm later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded its citation Thursday by saying that Grass
goes ``deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of
good and evil.'' Perhaps in no other country but Germany, home to
Goethe and to Goebbels, to Heine and to Hitler, is this
intertwining so intense. The author's authority rests in his power
to imbue his prose with a matching intensity.
</P>
<P>
   As Grass writes in ``Dog Years,'' ``While God was still at
school, in the heavenly playground he came up with the idea of
creating the world, together with his schoolmate, the talented
little devil.''
</P>
<P>
   This devil, moreover, was powerful, seductive to a conformist
nation, and often cleverly disguised. ``He's coming. He's coming.
Who is coming?'' Grass writes in ``The Tin Drum.'' ``The Christ
child, the Saviour? Or is it the heavenly gasman with the gas meter
under his arm, that always goes ticktock?''
