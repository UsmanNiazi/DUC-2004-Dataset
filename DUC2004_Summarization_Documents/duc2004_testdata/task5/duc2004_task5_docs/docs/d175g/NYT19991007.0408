   IRAN: PAPER BOUNCES BACK
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks after a press court closed the reformist
newspaper Neshat for ``insulting Islam,'' the editors and reporters
involved in its publication used another publishing license to
begin a new daily, Asre Azadegan, that is almost identical in
layout, content and editorial line. The new paper is the fourth the
reformist group has put out in the past 16 months, after three
predecessors, including Neshat, were ordered closed.

   IRAN: U.S. REJECTED ON RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   Iran has rejected a State Department report that designated Iran
and four other countries violators of religious freedoms. The
official news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying
that ``followers of divine religions practice their religion in
complete freedom'' in Iran, and dismissing as ``baseless'' the
State Department's accusation that Bahais had been persecuted.

   ITALY: SPYING FOR SOVIETS
</P>
<P>
   Files leaked by the former KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, whose
newly published revelations have resounded through Europe, suggest
that as many as 261 Italian journalists, diplomats and politicians
sold secrets to the Soviet Union. In Italy, the scandal focuses
less on high-level spies than on even higher-level ignorance.
British intelligence obtained the file in 1992. A former defense
secretary, Beniamino Andreatta, said he first learned of the spy
ring in 1996. Former Prime Minister Romano Prodi said he was never
told.

   SWITZERLAND: SLAVES' FREEDOM BOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group said it had bought the freedom of 4,300
more African slaves in Sudan, paying $50 a person. Christian
Solidarity International, a Zurich-based group, has previously
bought the freedom of people enslaved in Sudan, incurring criticism
from Unicef that it was encouraging trafficking. The group has paid
for the return of 15,447 people.

   GERMANY: GRASS DUMPS LAFONTAINE
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Grass, the new Nobel literature laureate and veteran
Social Democrat, said he was ending his friendship with Oskar
Lafontaine, the former Social Democratic finance minister, over his
powerful personal attack on Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in his
autobiography, ``The Heart Beats on the Left.'' Grass said ``the
damage he's done to his own party is too great and all I can say to
him is `Shut up!' ''

   GERMANY: SEIZED AS KILLER OF JEWS
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors announced that Julius Viel, an 81-year-old former
Nazi SS officer, had been arrested after accounts by some 900
witnesses that he shot dead seven Jews in Theresienstadt
concentration camp in 1945. He was arrested at his home near
Wangen, close to the Austrian border. The killings were said to
have taken place in early 1945 while the victims were digging
antitank trenches near the Czech town of Leitmeritz.

   KOSOVO: GERMAN HEADS NATO FORCE
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of Germany takes over Friday as commander
of KFOR, as the Kosovo peacekeeping force is known, replacing Gen.
Sir Mike Jackson of Britain, who has been leading NATO's mission in
the Yugoslav province since May. He is the first German officer to
take command of a NATO mission outside his homeland, a choice that
has been largely seen as the natural outgrowth of Germany's renewed
role in world affairs.

   MEXICO: PARTY LEADER ACCUSED
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Madrazo, a former governor who is seeking the governing
party's presidential nomination, demanded the resignation of the
party chief, Jose Gonzalez Fernandez, accusing him of collaborating
quietly with Francisco Labastida, a former interior minister who is
Madrazo's main rival in the primary race. The accusations by
Madrazo, who represents a wing of the party opposed to President
Ernesto Zedillo, appeared to increase chances of a party rupture
after the Nov. 7 primary.
