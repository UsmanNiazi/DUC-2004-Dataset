<HEADLINE> Guenter Grass Wins Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Praise poured in from literary colleagues after  
novelist Guenter Grass, Germany's best-known postwar writer, was 
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Academy in Stockholm, Sweden, honored Grass on  
Thursday as one of the most prominent authors to emerge from a 
group of young intellectuals who set out to revive German 
literature after the Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 71-year-old author of ``The Tin Drum,'' the prize  
bolstered his standing as a moral arbiter of post-unity Germany who 
has untiringly warned his compatriots to remain vigilant against 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	British author Salman Rushdie, in a statement through his agent,  
called Grass ``the greatest European novelist of the second half of 
the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is widely admired by his literary contemporaries, but also  
controversial for his outspoken political stands. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once said the horrors of Auschwitz could not have  
occurred without a strong Germany was horrified at the nation's 
quick unification in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 
has never shed his fear that Germany may stray again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be that my children and grandchildren will have to  
suffer under the stigma of being German,'' he said after Thursday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``But these late-born children also have a share of the  
responsibility for ensuring that such things -- even their stirrings 
-- never happen in Germany again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, publishers rushed Grass' books into print to meet huge  
demand in the wake of the Nobel announcement. Bookstores set up 
special tables with his works as Germans snapped them up. The 
Steidl publishing house, which holds the rights to his works, said 
its entire stock of some 100,000 Grass books sold out after the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, German public television paid an unlikely tribute to  
Grass: It had him read an early-morning weather forecast that 
combined the mundane with his leftist views. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outdoors, Grass said Sunday would be sunny in the  
south. He then urged people in neighboring Austria to turn out to 
vote against a rightist party whose popularity is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass has infuriated politicians in recent years with critiques  
of ``barbaric'' capitalism taking over after communism and by 
attacking German immigration policy as racist. 
</P>
<P>
	His literary reputation was made with ``The Tin Drum,'' ``Cat  
and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``The Tin Drum,'' the Nobel Academy said, ``it was as if  
German literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of 
linguistic and moral destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book's main character, Oskar Matzerath, refuses to grow up  
under the Nazi regime, staying a dwarf in protest and beating his 
tin drum as a warning. German director Volker Schloendorff later 
based a movie on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images, the novel  
trilogy captured the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the 
horrors of the war and the guilt that lingered after Adolf Hitler's 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass drew on his own experience of military service in the Nazi  
air force late in World War II and his captivity as a prisoner of 
war held by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Again and again, his books returned to his native town of Danzig  
(now Gdansk, Poland), a symbol of Germany's painful relationship 
with its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never failed to confront Germans with what they did, but  
always with a great sense of the vitality,'' 1991 Nobel laureate 
Nadine Gordimer told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, some reactions were more muted. Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder honored Grass as a ``competent critic of society.'' His 
culture minister, Michael Naumann, called him a ``difficult, 
imaginative author.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Grass' more recent works received decidedly mixed  
reviews. His 1995 novel ``A Broad Field'' attempted to explain 
Germany's new identity after unification, but many critics said it 
fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass and other German writers of his generation are criticized  
in a recent book, ``The Language of Silence,'' by Ernestine 
Schlant, a professor of German and comparative literature at New 
Jersey's Montclair State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlant, the German-born wife of Democratic presidential  
candidate Bill Bradley, says the writers' books virtually ignore 
the Holocaust and experiences of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass' latest work, ``My Century,'' is a collection of short  
pieces reviewing German history, coupled with an exhibition of 
Grass watercolors. The book is to be published in 23 languages by 
the end of next year.
