	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Novelist Guenter Grass, whose  
explorations of Germany's troubled century made him one of the 
best-known German writers of the post-World War II generation, won 
the 1999 Nobel Prize in literature today. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone call from the Swedish Academy informing him of the  
choice brought a smile from the 71-year-old author. ``I'm happy,'' 
he told journalists after emerging with his wife and dog from his 
house in Behlendorf in northern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was constantly a candidate for 20 years. That kept me  
young,'' he said in a later German radio interview. ``Now, old age 
is irrevocably starting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish Academy cited Grass' first novel, ``The Tin Drum,''  
published in 1959, for ushering in a new era for German literature 
``after decades of linguistic and moral destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here he comes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing  
contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: 
the victims, losers and lies that people wanted to forget because 
they had once believed in them,'' the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not too audacious to assume that `The Tin Drum' will  
become one of the enduring literary works of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images and  
events, Grass established his reputation with ``The Tin Drum,'' 
``Cat and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively known as The Danzig Trilogy, the novels captured  
the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the horrors of war and 
the guilt that lingered in the aftermath of Adolf Hitler's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder praised Grass today as a  
``competent critic of society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All Germans are celebrating with him,'' said Schroeder, who  
learned of the honor while on an official visit to the Czech 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadine Gordimer, the South African who won the 1991 literature  
prize, praised this year's selection. ``It's about time,'' she 
said, calling Grass one of the great writers of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``His writing had a great political significance, especially in  
the renaissance of Germany after the World War. He never failed to 
confront Germans with what they did, but always with a great sense 
of the vitality that was in the people and still is there,'' she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a group of postwar writers seeking a new beginning  
from German literature after the Third Reich, Grass has chronicled 
the Nazi era, the difficult years of postwar reconstruction, the 
social upheavals of the 1960s and German unification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass and other German writers of his generation are criticized  
in a recent book, ``The Language of Silence,'' by Ernestine 
Schlant, a professor of German and comparative literature at New 
Jersey's Montclair State University. Schlant, the German-born wife 
of Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, says the 
writers' books virtually ignore the Holocaust and experiences of 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous since ``The Tin Drum,'' Grass consistently used his  
position to speak out on political issues with a leftist bent. 
</P>
<P>
	When communist East Germany merged with the West in 1990, Grass  
looked on warily. ``Capitalism has never been more barbaric, 
beastlike than after the victory over the communist system,'' he 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass gave his view on German unification in ``A Broad Field,''  
giving the Stasi -- the dreaded East German secret police -- a 
prominent role in the book. But many critics said Grass had let 
down the nation by failing to produce the great, sweeping 
``unification novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Grass called the then conservative German government's  
policies on refugees and asylum-seekers ``democratically covered 
barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Academy secretary Horace Engdahl, who announced the prize, said  
the academy ignored Grass' controversial nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, Guenter Grass has been surrounded by storms fairly  
often,'' he said. ``This (reunification) was perhaps the worst 
storm, but we don't take those things into consideration. We sit 
down and read the book, and the book is darn good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he remains politically outspoken, Grass seems to have  
mellowed in recent years. To some, his sweeping look back in his 
book ``My Century,'' published this year, suggests an author coming 
to peace with the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass is the fifth consecutive European to win the prize and  
Germany's seventh Nobel literature laureate. The last was Heinrich 
Boell in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The literature prize has been given to writers with worldviews  
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the 
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness. The prize even has gone 
occasionally to writers who did not work in fiction or poetry, 
notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Saramago of Portugal, a nonconformist with a soft spot for  
the common man, was last year's laureate. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine is to be announced  
Monday, the physics and chemistry winners on Tuesday, the economics 
laureate on Wednesday and the peace prize on Oct. 15. All the prize 
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize, which 
is given in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf will present the prizes, this year  
worth $960,000, on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement was a slight break from tradition. The  
academy usually names the literature winner on a Thursday in 
October. The early announcement indicated the academy was solidly 
behind Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an easy choice,'' Engdahl said. ``He has a lot to say  
and his writing carries great weight. He won the love of the 
academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Prizes are funded by a trust set up in the will of  
Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Nobel 
said the literature prize should recognize an author whose work 
moves in an ``ideal direction'' without specifying exactly what he 
meant.
