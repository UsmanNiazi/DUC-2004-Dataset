<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The German author Guenter
Grass said Thursday after being informed that he had won the 1999
Nobel Prize for Literature that he was always trying to succeed
the tradition of German literature.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his office in Luebecker, a harbor city in northern
Germany, Grass said, "Heinrich Boehl must have been pleased with
the choice. I have always tried to succeed his tradition."
</P>
<P>
Boehl, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972, was the
latest German writer to be recognized internationally. Following
him, Grass was the 11th German author to have won the prize since
1901 when the prize was founded.
</P>
<P>
Grass, 71, has achieved worldwide fame by his novels such as
"The Tin Drum," "The Cat And Mouse," and "The Dog Years."
</P>
<P>
"It (the Nobel prize) might help calm my nerves.... This prize
gave me great satisfaction," he said, referring to the fact that
he had been the candidate for the prize for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Born in Danzig (now named Gdansk in Poland), Grass began his
career in the city of Duesseldorf beside the Rhine River as a
student for sculpture.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, Grass lived in Paris where he made his
living as a writer and graphic artist. It was in these years that
Grass wrote "The Tin Drum," his most famous novel that depicted a
boy who refused to grow up.
</P>
<P>
An audacious spokesman for Germany's national affairs and a
supporter of the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SPD), Grass
regularly weighs in on German public debates. He stridently voiced
his opinion from reunification to citizenship laws.
</P>
<P>
German leaders, all Grass' friends in the SPD, congratulated
the writer with warm words.
</P>
<P>
"I am so pleased that my long-year friend, Guenter Grass,
really deserves the prizes," said German President Johannes Rau.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also praised Grass in a
telegram, saying: "I think the prize was given to one of our
greatest writers in this century."
</P>
<P>
"No other German writers has achieved so much international
fame than this fantastic author from Danzig," said Michael
Naumann, German culture minister.
</P>
<P>
And in the German parliament, all the lawmakers, including
those of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
applauded for Grass.
