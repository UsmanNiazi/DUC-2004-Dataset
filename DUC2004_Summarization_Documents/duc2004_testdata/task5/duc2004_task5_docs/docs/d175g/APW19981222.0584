	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in remarks
published Tuesday, upheld his government's proposal to build a
Holocaust museum and research center in Berlin instead of a
long-debated huge sculpture.
	   German Jewish leaders have criticized the plan unveiled last
week by culture minister Michael Naumann as not powerful enough to
commemorate the killing of 6 million Jews by the Nazis. But
Schroeder insisted the idea was ``good.''
	   ``It not only helps recall the horror of the Nazi era but also
allows young people to learn something,'' he said in an interview
with the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
	   Last weekend's bombing of the Berlin grave of a former German
Jewish leader, Heinz Galinski, ``shows how important this
remains,'' he said.
	   Germany's best-known author, novelist Guenter Grass, said he
would back the museum if it is dedicated to all victims of the
Nazis, not only Jews.
	   Half a million Gypsies were killed by the Third Reich as well as
homosexuals and political prisoners, the author of ``The Tin Drum''
noted in an interview with the weekly Die Woche.
	   German politicians and intellectuals have debated plans for a
national Holocaust memorial for 10 years. A plot in central Berlin
has been set aside for it.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,500
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl was the project's biggest backer.
But Schroeder, a Social Democrat who defeated Kohl in September
elections, has expressed doubts about the monument. Parliament is
to decide how to proceed next year.
