`MY CENTURY': 100 YEARS OF INCERTITUDE

<P>
   Works of literature are rarely if ever created for an occasion _
a birthday, an anniversary, the passing of a millennium _ and that
is perhaps the reason ``My Century,'' Guenter Grass' fictional
gloss on the past 100 years, falls so flat. Grass, who won the
Nobel Prize in Literature last year, has, like his German
predecessor Thomas Mann, produced powerfully imaginative fables of
grotesque politics and personal fate. ``The Tin Drum,'' his
masterpiece, is indisputably one of the great novels since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   But ``My Century,'' in which Grass produces a vignette for each
year since 1900, has only flashes of the brilliance of his best
work. More often it drifts, plods and fails to stir the mind or
heart in the way that one might expect when a writer of this
stature deals with a mighty subject.
</P>
<P>
   Grass does deserve credit for writing a strange book and one
that captures the kaleidoscopic quality of the 100 years just past.
But it is a pale, watery sort of kaleidoscope, providing
unsatisfactorily fragmentary glances at people and events that
disappear almost as soon as they are seen.
</P>
<P>
   He uses ever changing narrators who succeed one another through
the generations, beginning with a foot soldier in the European and
American expeditionary force that was sent to relieve the siege of
the foreign legation during the Boxer Rebellion in China. There are
civil servants and bureaucrats, writers, working-class housewives,
an employee of Deutsche Grammophon who in 1907 goes to Moscow and
signs up the great Chaliapin to an exclusive contract.
</P>
<P>
   But with a few exceptions _ notably the working-class women
scattered through these pages _ the voices, while recounting
different experiences, are similar in tone and very similar in
their storytelling technique.
</P>
<P>
   That technique is the overused one of trying, with a few teaser
sentences at the beginning of each segment, to keep the reader from
knowing for a while exactly who is talking or what is taking place.
So the entry for 1934 begins: ``Just between the two of us, the
matter should have been handled better. I let myself by carried
away by personal considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker here is a guard at the Dachau and Oranienburg
concentration camps whose principal concern is bureaucratic
politics. The point is the way in which historical actors lose
sight of when they are as moral agents. But the technique of
presentation is used often enough to become wearying. Many of
Grass' narrators suffer from a form of historical myopia, so they
see events not in grand terms but solipsistically, for their
personal effect. The main years of World War II, for example, are
covered by a single narrator, who, in 1962, participates in a
three-day meeting of journalists looking back, each in his own way,
on the disaster of the recent past. The assembled journalists talk
about missed opportunities as if World War II had been a lost
football game rather than an apocalyptic effort to realize a vast
criminal vision.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer who recorded the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto
in 1943 complains that he received no royalties, not even for his
most famous picture, ``showing a group of women and children with
their hands up and our men on the right and in the background
pointing their guns at them.'' He continues, ``Not a penny have I
earned, not a single measly mark.''
</P>
<P>
   When Grass, who was born in 1937, gets closer to our own times,
he becomes his own narrator, talking mostly of his leftist
political ideas and of his tortured avoidance of the radical
extreme. He thinks back to the 1960s, agonizing over a set of
questions too obscure to summarize here, but having to do with a
poem by Paul Celan in which he awaits some acknowledgment from
philosopher Martin Heidegger of Heidegger's collaboration with the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Grass delves into several subjects: the left's disenchantment
with the great sociologist and philosopher Theodor Adorno; the
shooting of Rudi Dutschke, the provocateur of the German student
movement; a meeting between Celan and Heidegger. These episodes,
which take up the years from 1966 to 1968, could have been a
fascinating excursion into recent German politics, but in ``My
Century'' they come across as arcane, tangential, unfocused, even
as Grass himself seems to be posing for an author's photograph
while bearing the weight of some Heavy Question on his thin
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did it occur, my `turn?''' he asks, using the word turn
in an existential Heideggerean sense. ``What caused me to take
leave from `merely being'? And precisely when during all those
years did the sublime take hold of me, never _ a temporary `turning
away' notwithstanding _ to let go?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Grass' segments, like the one with the Warsaw Ghetto
photographer, provide the sort of absurdist insight that one
expects from this author. His passage on 1989, the year the Berlin
Wall came down, is about a man pleased to learn that German
unification has occurred because he needs snow tires, and they are
hard to get in the suddenly defunct East where he lives. Or there
is the grandfather of 1978, a prominent banker in the Nazi era, who
unwittingly cures his grandchildren of their love for punk by
becoming punk himself, shaving his head and sticking safety pins
into his ear lobes, before being committed to an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes have a wryly distanced quality that is itself
perhaps Grass' central comment on the 100 years just past,
accentuating as it does the impossibility of a full engagement with
the historical colossus that the century was. A willfully vague
semiunderstanding pervades the collective mentality represented by
his various voices and points of view in confrontation with the
unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   But ``My Century'' remains a work whose parts, while
sporadically gripping and uniformly intelligent, do not manage to
add up to a coherent, gripping or illuminating whole. One reads
these mostly forgettable fragments, and one hopes for the years to
provide more literary or moral mass than they attain in what is a
strange, searching, yet disappointing book.
