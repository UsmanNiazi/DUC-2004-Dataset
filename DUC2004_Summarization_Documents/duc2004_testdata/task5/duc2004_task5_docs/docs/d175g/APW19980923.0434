Leading French Socialist launches appeal in favor of Clinton

	   PARIS (AP) _ Former French Culture Minister Jack Lang on
Wednesday brought together film stars and writers to launch
international appeal in favor of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Film stars Sophia Loren, Gerard Depardieu and Lauren Bacall were
among those who signed the petition. Others included Nobel Prize
winners Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Desmond Tutu.
	   The appeal, excerpts of which appeared in the Le Monde daily,
said Clinton has been subjected to ``inquisitorial harassment by a
fanatical prosecutor with unlimited power.''
	   It accused prosecutor Kenneth Starr of endangering democracy by
upsetting the balance of power and by his ``flagrant intrusions''
into private life.
	   The signatories of the appeal objected to what they believe is
the ``oppression'' that Clinton has suffered as a result of the
investigation into his sexual conduct.
	   ``A statesman has only to account for his public actions before
the public or the judicial system. All the rest is a matter of his
conscience,'' the appeal said.
	   Other prominent figures who signed the appeal included Clinton's
friend, the writer William Styron, German writer Guenter Grass, as
well as actresses Vanessa Redgrave and Liv Ullmann.
	   Lang, who is now a Socialist member of the French parliament,
has spoken out frequently in favor of Clinton.
	   Many French people find the investigation against Clinton an
intrusion into private life and are opposed to it.
