German coalition split over conservative's foreigner's suggestion

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition was
split Friday over a suggestion by a conservative Bavarian
politician to set up separate facilities to process desired and
undesired foreigners entering the country.
	   The deputy General Secretary of Bavaria's ultra-conservative
Christian Social Union, Joachim Herrmann, has suggested that
skilled people coming to work in Germany should not have to stand
in line to be processed with undesired or criminal types seeking
entry.
	   In an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio in Cologne, Guido
Westerwelle, the General Secretary of the junior coalition centrist
Free Democrats, said Herrmann's proposal ``lacked basic
knowledge.''
	   Westerwelle said he could only try to explain Hermann's
comment's as coming from someone ``who is trying to compete in a
race with radical rightists.''
	   He said the proposal was ``awakening ghosts that one can't be
rid of later,'' and gave ``cause for concern.''
	   Hermann contacted by reporters tried to play down his
suggestion, saying it was already practiced in the European Union
at airports that have special gates for EU passengers to process
more rapidly through customs.
	   In another development Friday, the Berlin-based Tageszeitung
newspaper reported that about 130 prominent people, including
author Guenter Grass and theology professor Friedrich Schorlemmer,
have signed a petition appealing to all political parties to
refrain from using the foreigners' issue in the election campaign.
	   That issue was used by the radical rightist German People's
Union party in eastern Saxony Anhalt in April when it won nearly 13
percent of the vote to gain 16 seats in the state parliament.
	   Germany's national parliament elections are set for Sept. 27.
