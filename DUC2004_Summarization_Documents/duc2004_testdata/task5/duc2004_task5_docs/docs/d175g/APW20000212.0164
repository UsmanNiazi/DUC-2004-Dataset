<HEADLINE> Jewish Leader: Scandals Help Right  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A major Jewish leader warned Saturday that German disgust with
current political scandals may end up strengthening far-right parties like in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the danger that in the next elections, (German far-right parties)
will receive more encouragement than they have so far because of the visible
disaffection for politics,'' Paul Spiegel, president of the Central Council of
Jews in Germany, told the Magdeburger Volksstimme newspaper. The council is the
political arm of Germany's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Spiegel came as a leaders of the Free Democrats, a small,
market-oriented party, voted Saturday in the state of Hesse to stay in a
coalition with Christian Democratic Governor Roland Koch -- despite his
admission on Tuesday to having lied about the source of party funds.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel noted that many Austrians who supported Joerg Haider's right-wing
Freedom Party -- which entered the government in Vienna last week, sparking an
international outcry -- were apparently protest voters angry over allegations of
corruption in the mainstream parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats previously had high hopes that Koch could help lead
them out of the scandal sparked by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's revelation in
December that he illegally kept large political donations off the books.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Gerhard, national chairman of the Free Democrats, urged a
withdrawal from the coalition at Saturday's meeting, worried that the taint of
scandal covering the Christian Democrats could rub off on them. But the state
board voted 15-7 to stick with Koch, thus saving his year-old government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's a party crisis and not a government crisis,'' state
chairman Ruth Wagner said in explaining the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Leading German intellectuals including Nobel laureate Guenter Grass and
philosopher Juergen Habermas published an open letter Saturday calling for new
elections in Hesse, which includes the financial capital of Frankfurt.
