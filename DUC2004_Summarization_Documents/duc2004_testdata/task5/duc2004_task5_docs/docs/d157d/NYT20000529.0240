TIME MAGAZINE SUGGESTS BUSH FAVORS DANFORTH AS RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A newsweekly's suggestion that George W. Bush
favors former Sen. Jack Danforth of Missouri as his running mate
has the state's Republicans struggling to keep their favorite-son
hopes in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would do great things for the ticket and go a long way to
delivering a key state,'' said John Hancock, executive director of
the Missouri Republican Party. ``(But) it's a little premature for
us to be getting too excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine reported over the Memorial Day weekend that
Danforth, 63, figures heavily in Bush's calculations about whom to
tap for the Republican vice presidential nomination. ``What name
does Bush return to in his private ruminations?'' the magazine
asked. ``Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, Danforth fits several of Bush's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth long has been firmly opposed to abortion and so would
appease a vocal wing of his own party. The rest of his politics
generally falls into a more moderate or free-thinking pattern that
could appeal to the political middle. He opposed
government-mandated school prayer and a constitutional amendment to
ban flag burning, and he backed most civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from a state with 11 electoral votes that has voted for
the winner in every presidential election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   And Danforth enjoys a record built on 18 years in the Senate
with a reputation for independence and without serious scandal. It
landed him the job as special counsel to study whether federal
officials unnecessarily killed anyone _ or tried to cover up their
actions _ at the April 19, 1993, destruction of the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas. His report is expected before the fall
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows Jack Danforth knows that he is one of the
great purists in politics'' and is largely immune to partisan
pressure, said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's reputation as a political moderate would win strong
reviews with the country's media elite, Sabato said, while his
pro-life record and shepherding of Clarence Thomas' 1991
confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court would serve him well among
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sabato said, Danforth's low-key, almost modest style as
a public figure suits someone running as a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would strengthen Bush,'' Sabato said, ``without outshining
him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not Danforth's first dance with a presumptive Republican
presidential nominee. When the elder George Bush was looking for a
running mate in 1988, a Danforth associate said, the senator's
campaign responded to Bush's request for detailed records typically
asked only of the final three to five possible choices.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush chose, at some political expense, Dan Quayle, and
Danforth served six more years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Washington in early 1995, Danforth has worked
mostly in St. Louis. He is a partner in the Bryan Cave law firm and
sits on several corporate boards, including that of media giant
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Danforth comes from a wealthy family. He is an heir
to the Ralston Purina fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also share personal connections. Danforth is close a
friend of William ``Bucky'' Bush, an uncle of the Texas governor
and St. Louis businessmen. In addition, one of George W. Bush's
chief advisors and fund raisers is Jack Oliver, who worked on
Danforth campaigns and was an intern in his Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   The Time article reads like a trial balloon for a Danforth
nomination, suggesting the Texas governor is smitten with the idea
of the former Missouri politician without making clear the source
of the story. Officially, the campaign would not humor any rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details are being kept between Governor Bush and Dick
Cheney,'' spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said, referring to the former
defense secretary heading the Republican search for a vice
presidential candidate. ``The governor's looking at a lot of
different people.''
