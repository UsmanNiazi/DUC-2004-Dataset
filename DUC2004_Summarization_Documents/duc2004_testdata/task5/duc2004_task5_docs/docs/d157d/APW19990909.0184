<HEADLINE> Danforth Seen As Fair, Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ordained Episcopal priest, former Sen. John  
C. Danforth is often tagged by friends and foes alike as ``St. 
Jack,'' a nickname he eschews but that sums up both his reputation 
for integrity -- and stubborn independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies call the Missouri Republican the perfect choice to head  
an independent inquiry into the fiery end -- and a fatal for 80 
people -- to the FBI's 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian compound 
in Waco, Texas, in 1993. He was chosen for the job today by 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Danforth's entire public life was a testament to  
integrity in government,'' said Walter McCormick, a longtime Senate 
Commerce Committee aide to the senator. ``He will get to the bottom 
of it, and there will be no hide-the-ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of another erstwhile adviser, Supreme Court Justice  
Clarence Thomas, viewed Danforth's moral integrity as a beacon that 
guided her husband's stormy confirmation hearings in October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of sexual harassment by a former colleague, Anita Hill,  
the conservative black jurist ultimately survived the controversy 
to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall, a liberal champion 
of civil rights and the first black member of the high court. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Danforth had also emerged as a civil rights leader and  
was preparing to battle the Bush White House to pass the 1991 Civil 
Rights Act aimed at protecting the jobs of women and minorities. At 
the time, the lanky Missourian characterized the paradox as ``an 
interesting happenstance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're lucky they've found a man who can restore  
trust when an institution's credibility is in question,'' Ginni 
Thomas, the justice's wife, said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``He's a man who very easily and naturally 
combines the principles of his religious faith with public 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled how, during the 10 days of hearings, the Thomases  
and Danforths prayed in the Senate Russell Office Building's 
bathroom moments before Thomas made his first statement at his 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	A grandson of the founder of the Ralston Purina animal food  
empire, Danforth, 63, was born to wealth. He was active in his 
family's philanthropies and while in Washington ministered to 
elderly shut-ins and conducted Tuesday morning services at St. 
Alban's Church. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Yale Seminary and Yale Law School, he was elected  
to the Senate in 1976 after holding the Missouri attorney general's 
job for eight years. In Missouri, he is viewed as the progenitor of 
the modern Republicanism, with two of his proteges, Christopher 
Bond and John Ashcroft, now holding the state's two seats in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a capacity to be a bulldog,'' said Ashcroft, who won  
the race to replace the retiring Danforth in 1994. ``He's a man 
without prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, Danforth was sometimes called ``St. Jack,'' both by  
admirers of his virtue and nonconformity and by critics who saw him 
as self-righteous. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth is a fiscal conservative but is progressive on social  
issues, with the exception of staunch anti-abortion views. He has 
opposed the death penalty, fought prayer in public schools, argued 
against efforts to criminalize flag burning and defended the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Danforth has served as chairman of a civic  
group working to revitalize St. Louis with projects ranging from 
beautification to stopping racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls them like he sees them,'' former Sen. Thomas  
Eagleton, a Missouri Democrat who served 10 years with Danforth, 
told the AP. ``Members of the Senate or House will have full faith 
in his finding.''
