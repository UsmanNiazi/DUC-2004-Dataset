   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jack Danforth for vice president?
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the former senator from Missouri was back
on Texas Gov. George W. Bush's short list of potential running
mates was the subject of another frantic round of political
speculation Friday _ at least in Danforth's home state.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney emerged
as a leading contender after switching his voter registration from
Texas to Wyoming, which removed a constitutional impediment to his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth himself has fueled much of the buzz based on what he's
said. And not said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday in St. Louis to release his
preliminary report on the government's assault on the Branch
Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, Danforth parried question after
question about his interest in the vice presidency with some
version of ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he didn't deny that he might be interested.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Kansas City Star, Danforth said he
didn't think the Waco briefing was the right venue to discuss his
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to talk about it,'' Danforth said, obviously
tired of the questions. ``This is a different subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's non-answers weren't the only thing fueling the talk.
The Republican's decision to release the report Friday _ instead of
in the fall when the report was expected _ gave rise to scuttlebutt
that Danforth was clearing the decks so that he would be available
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Thursday night by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch whether
he would ``unequivocally'' state that he would not be the vice
presidential candidate, Danforth said through a spokeswoman that
there was ``no answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday in Washington, however, much of the running-mate
speculation focused on others: Arizona's Sen. John McCain, who this
week indicated an interest in the office; Cheney, who is in charge
of Bush's vice presidential search; and Oklahoma Gov. Frank
Keating, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's name didn't even appear in some national news
organizations' vice presidential roundup stories, although GOP
strategist Rich Galen said he was hearing a lot of talk about
Danforth in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of only three people being mentioned,'' Galen
insisted. ``It's Danforth, McCain and Keating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign wasn't commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has asked his campaign staff to not enter into
speculation,'' said Tucker Eskew, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   So the amount of Danforth talk grounded in fact and in idle
media speculation remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the speculation, particularly among
Missouri Republicans who stand to gain if a favorite son is on the
national ticket. The party is engaged in competitive races with
Democrats up and down the ballot this year, including the John
Ashcroft-Mel Carnahan Senate race and the Jim Talent-Bob Holden
race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would likely sprain my back doing cartwheels'' if Danforth
was picked, said John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Danforth almost certainly would serve if Bush asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that if Governor Bush called him up and
said, `I need you to do this,' that he would do it,'' said Talent
of Chesterfield, Mo., a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's name first surfaced in May when Time magazine
reported that the Missourian, a lawyer who left public office in
1995 after three terms in the Senate, was on Bush's short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``What name does Bush return to in his private ruminations?''
the magazine asked. ``Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-June, Danforth, 63, publicly backed away, saying that
running for national office would take too much from his personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with politics, particularly at that level, is that
it crowds out everything else,'' Danforth told The Star on June 13.
``I just think it would have bumped everything else, and I didn't
want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the wishes of Danforth's wife, Sally. Ann
Wagner, chairwoman of the Missouri GOP, said Friday that Sally
Danforth no longer objected to her husband running for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Danforth would bring considerable dignity to the
ticket. The integrity of Danforth, an Episcopal priest, is
unchallenged and he earned bipartisan respect for his willingness
to work with members of both parties. He is an abortion opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was re-elected for the last time in 1988 with 68
percent support, and his selection would go a long way toward
assuring that Missouri's 11 Electoral College votes swung
Republican. A recent poll The Star commissioned gave Bush an
11-point lead over Gore in Missouri, although Democrats are
confident of narrowing that gap.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, Republicans would have to contend with
lingering resentment from women stemming from Danforth's unwavering
defense of Clarence Thomas in 1991 in the wake of Anita Hill's
allegations. Others suggested that Danforth had so much stature
that he might outshine Bush in a side-by-side comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Danforth was picked,'' said Missouri Democratic Party
executive director Roy Temple, ``at least we would know that Bush
would have adult supervision.''  &LR; tag1:The Star's Oscar Avila
contributed to this report.
