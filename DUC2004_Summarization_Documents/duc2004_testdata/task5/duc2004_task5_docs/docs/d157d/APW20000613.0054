<HEADLINE> Report: Danforth Rebuffs Vice Pres.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former Sen. John Danforth has withdrawn his
name from the list of potential running mates for George W. Bush,
according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the idea of running for vice president ''very
tempting'' and ''would have been a dream.'' But, after mulling it
over for two weeks, he said he and his wife Sally decided they
didn't want to give up living in Missouri and their close contact
with family here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want politics to totally define who we were,''
Danforth told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in a story for Tuesday's
paper. ''The last six years have been the best years of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 after three terms,
is now the special counsel overseeing an investigation in the Waco
standoff and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports placed him on a short list of vice presidential
prospects for Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he called Bush and former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who heads Bush's vice presidential search team, last week
about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made up his mind after waking up in the middle of the
night with the memory of a visit by then-Secretary of State George
Shultz when Danforth was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a couple of Secret Service people standing in our
back yard in the dark, and I remembered that,'' Danforth said.
''It's the fact that if you do that (high-level of a) job, it
crowds out everything else in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign press secretary Mindy Tucker declined to comment
Monday.
