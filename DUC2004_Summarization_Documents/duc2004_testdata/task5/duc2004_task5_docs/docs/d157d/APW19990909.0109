<HEADLINE> Danforth Vows Thorough Waco Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vowing to pursue the ``dark questions'' of the  
Waco siege, former Republican Sen. John Danforth opened an 
independent inquiry Thursday into whether the FBI started the 
deadly fire and later tried to cover its actions. He pledged a 
thorough inquiry that could include questioning of Attorney General 
Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, talking to reporters at the White House,  
applauded the selection of Danforth, calling him ``an honorable man 
and an intelligent and straightforward man. The only thing I would 
ask is that he conduct a thorough and prompt investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton added that ``I certainly don't think there's any  
reason'' for Reno to resign as several Republican leaders have 
urged. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in the Justice Department, where Reno  
announced she had appointed him, Danforth said the country can 
survive bad judgment, ``but the thing that really undermines the 
integrity of government is whether there were bad acts, whether 
there was a cover-up and whether the government killed people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth  
said. ``How did the fire start? Were there shootings?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his inquiry would include whether false statements were  
made to Congress and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, who said he has authority to question both Reno and  
Freeh, will hold the title special counsel and is empowered to use 
a federal grand jury for his investigation. He said he hoped to get 
voluntary cooperation for what will start as an administrative, not 
a criminal, inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Danforth also will investigate whether there ``was any  
illegal use of the armed forces'' in the final assault. Members of 
the Pentagon's Delta Force commandoes were at Waco the day of the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, who spoke with Danforth briefly this week, said in a  
statement that he welcomed the selection, and Reno called Danforth 
``a man of impeccable credentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the former senator made a round of courtesy calls on Capitol  
Hill, congressional leaders said they envision Congress' own Waco 
investigations will be more wide-ranging than Danforth's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know it all,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she herself had no plans to resign, despite calls from  
some Republicans to do so. ``I don't run from controversy,'' she 
said, removing herself entirely from the Waco matter from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will obviously be a witness, and I think it's important''  
the probe ``be conducted without influence of those who had been 
involved,'' Reno explained. With that, Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder would be the top person Danforth consults at Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has said that before the April 19, 1993, FBI assault on the  
Branch Davidian compound, she directed that only non-incendiary 
tear gas be used, to avoid the possibility of triggering a fire 
that might endanger lives. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been under renewed criticism since revelations that the  
FBI, contradicting a position it had taken for six years, had used 
some incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff, 
which ended in a fire and the deaths of David Koresh and about 80 
followers. Reno and the FBI maintain that the devices did not cause 
the deadly fire, which they insist was set by the cult members. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
Congress should not defer to the executive branch in delving into 
Waco because ``after all, Congress was misled by the executive 
branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that they would do it in the broadest possible  
way,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions Danforth said he would leave for Congress:  
whether it was a good idea for the FBI to have assaulted the 
compound on the final day and for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms to have raided it three months earlier, beginning the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth chose as his deputy the U.S. attorney in St. Louis,  
Edward Dowd, a Clinton appointee who is joining the St. Louis law 
firm where Danforth is a partner. A lifelong Democrat, Dowd was 
recommended for the U.S. attorney's job by House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. Dowd's father was the Democratic nominee for 
Missouri governor in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said the investigative legwork in his inquiry would be  
done by private investigators ``to the maximum extent'' possible 
and by ``some government investigators'' from agencies other than 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,''  
said Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``I can't say that under no circumstances would I  
call on any help at all from the FBI, because I don't know how the 
course of this will proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth will remain at his law firm in St. Louis but probably  
will open an office in Washington. Dowd will be full time on the 
probe, and Danforth will devote most of his time to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said some family members and friends advised him not to  
take the job, with one telling him it would not be a good career 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, hey, I'm 63'' and ``at this point in your life. ...''  
Danforth joked with reporters. He said the gravity of the questions 
surrounding Waco compelled him to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said he wants to present as many of the facts as he can  
to the American people -- a goal that could be difficult if his 
inquiry turns into a criminal investigation and he starts using a 
grand jury to question witnesses under oath. Grand jury testimony 
is secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth and the FBI agents could face some difficult choices.  
</P>
<P>
	Agents who cooperate voluntarily could be placing themselves in  
legal jeopardy by talking, depending on what evidence they provide. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agent refuses to answer, Danforth must decide whether to  
immunize the witness to compel him to talk, a step that would 
probably preclude Danforth from prosecuting the person later if 
Danforth decides the agent has engaged in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth is the first person to wield the powers spelled out in  
a new set of Justice Department regulations adopted in the wake of 
the expiration of the independent counsel statute June 30.
