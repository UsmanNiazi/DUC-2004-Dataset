<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., on Thursday
launched an independent investigation of the 1993 FBI siege of the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, saying he will focus
solely on whether federal agents helped set a deadly fire and then
tried to conceal their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who is investigating at the request of Attorney
General Janet Reno, pledged to determine if the FBI ignited the
inferno by firing pyrotechnic munitions at the religious sect's
facility. Reno, who for six years denied that federal agents used
flammable devices, appointed Danforth this week after the FBI
recently acknowledged firing pyrotechnic gas containers during the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth said. ``Did
the government kill people and did the government cover it up?''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Reno at the Justice Department, Danforth vowed to
get to the truth and said he had no ``preconceived ideas'' of what
happened April 19, 1993, or whether federal agents later lied about
what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will have broad authority to collect evidence and
subpoena witnesses. He will have the title of special counsel and
may impanel a grand jury to investigate criminal wrongdoing if he
believes crimes might have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priority is to get to the facts,'' said Danforth,
who left the Senate in 1995 to return to private law practice.
``We're going to do whatever is necessary to get to the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, said he and his deputy, U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
Jr. of St. Louis, would conduct an objective and ``expeditious''
investigation but gave no timetable for its completion. ``I don't
want this to go on and on,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 Branch Davidians, including cult leader David
Koresh, were killed by gunfire and the blaze that erupted during
the raid. Despite the FBI's recent revelations, Reno said she
continues to believe that Branch Davidians are solely responsible
for starting the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, noting the independence of his investigation, said he
intends to avoid using federal agents ``to the maximum extent that
I can'' in conducting the inquiry. Instead, he said he would rely
largely on ``private sector'' attorneys and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate from Reno, Danforth also may prosecute federal
crimes, should he deem it ``necessary and appropriate,'' that may
have occurred during the FBI siege and its aftermath. These crimes
might include perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of
evidence or intimidation of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has authority to oversee the special counsel's work,
recused herself from any oversight. She said it would be improper
because Danforth might find it necessary to question her in light
of her testimony before Congress that the FBI used no pyrotechnic
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will obviously be a witness,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Reno, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. will
oversee Danforth. Holder was a Superior Court judge in Washington,
D.C., when the raid occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Holder has assured him that he will have free
reign. ``I wouldn't have done this without it,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also will examine whether the U.S. military was
illegally involved in the FBI raid, because of allegations that the
Army's elite Delta Force anti-terrorism unit was present the day of
the raid. The Pentagon has acknowledged that military personnel
were there, but only in a consulting role.
</P>
<P>
   Under Justice Department regulations, Danforth must submit to
Reno a confidential report. In addition, Danforth said he will
submit a final report to be made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is to give the American people knowledge of what
happened,'' Danforth said. But he added that any testimony before a
grand jury would have to be kept confidential under federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier federal investigation of the raid concluded that some
Branch Davidians shot fellow members and deliberately set the fire
during the siege, which occurred after a 51-day stand off between
the cult and federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he will confine his investigation to whether
federal agents acted improperly, not whether they made errors in
judgment by engaging in a long stalemate with the cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into judgment calls even if the judgment
calls led to the (deadly) result.'' he said. ``Our country can
survive bad judgment. The thing that really undermines government
is whether there were bad acts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's recent revelations about the use of pyrotechnic
munitions has led many Republicans, including Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas and Senate GOP Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, to call for
Reno's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful Republican chairmen, such as Senate judiciary committee
leader Orrin Hatch of Utah, have called for congressional hearings
regarding what Reno and the FBI knew and when they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he planned to meet with congressional leaders
about his investigation but said he would not advise them on
whether they should proceed with their committee hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he will press ahead with a congressional inquiry,
despite noting his ``great deal of respect'' for Danforth as a
former Senate colleague and former Missouri attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, talking to reporters at the White House,
applauded the selection of Danforth, calling him ``an honorable man
and an intelligent and straightforward man. The only thing I would
ask is that he conduct a through and prompt investigation.''
