   WASHINGTON _ Opening an independent investigation of the 1993
FBI assault on a religious compound in Texas, former Sen. John
Danforth promised Thursday to answer the ``dark questions'' of the
Waco incident: ``Did the government kill people?'' and ``Was there
a cover-up?''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said core values of American democracy are at stake in
his inquiry into the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians and whether
federal officials lied and hid evidence after fire consumed the
sect's fortified home outside Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If government covers things up, if government kills people, if
that's what happened _ and I don't prejudge that _ then that
undermines what (Thomas) Jefferson talked about as being the very
foundation of government,'' explained Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a big thing,'' said Danforth. ``I think that it
is very important to try to get answers to questions that are
important for the whole integrity of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno announced Danforth's appointment as
the fulfillment of her pledge for an outside probe to finally ``get
to the bottom'' of the Waco controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Repubicans have been calling for Reno to resign
since the FBI belatedly disclosed that it had used military-issue
tear gas canisters on April 19, 1993, as the agency ended its
51-day seige of the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and other federal officials had denied for six years that
the devices, which use heat to disperse the tear gas, were used at
Waco. They still maintain that the Davidians, not the FBI, started
the deadly fires.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``I don't run from controversy,'' Reno said Thursday she
would stay on the job. However, she said her duties will no longer
include matters relating to Waco because ``I will obviously be a
witness'' in Danforth's probe.
</P>
<P>
   With Reno recused, Danforth will deal with Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will focus on ``bad acts'' rather than ``bad
judgment,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country can survive bad judgment,'' he explained. ``But
the thing that really undermines the integrity of government is
whether there were bad acts, whether there was a cover-up, and
whether ... the government killed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his investigation will answer those ``dark
questions,'' not second-guess ``judgment calls'' about the federal
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department orders that name Danforth a special
counsel authorize him to investigate specific areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether any government agents or officials lied or withheld,
altered or destroyed evidence about what went on at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether any government agents used incendiary devices or
engaged in gunfire at the Branch Davidian compound on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether government agents started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether there was any illegal use of U.S. military forces in
connection with the operation by federal law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The orders also call for ``public dissemination'' of the
findings ``to the maximum extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope and my intention that the facts that are
discovered will be made available to the American people, for that
is very, very important,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the special counsel is enpowered to convene a grand
jury and take testimony in private, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also said in a televised interview Thursday that he
would have the power to prosecute individuals for criminal
wrongdoing if that became necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he does not know how long the investigation will
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it would be a mistake to set a fixed time
limit,'' he said. ``I can tell you that my goals are first of all
to be absolutely objective, and I go into this with no preconceived
ideas whatever. So I'm going to be totally, totally objective. I'm
going to call 'em as I see 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he will enlist investigators and attorneys from
outside government to conduct at least most of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that the FBI should be investigating the
FBI,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a statement saying, ``I welcome
the attorney general's selection of Senator Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his chief deputy will be U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
of St. Louis, ``a person who is very highly regarded in our
community, a very respected prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd will leave his federal position and join Danforth's law
firm. A Democrat, Dowd was backed for his Justice Department
position by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco investigation will be headquartered in St. Louis, where
both Danforth and Dowd reside.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of several congressional committees have
declared their intent to hold hearings on the Waco incident and
will likely be calling the same witnesses that Danforth will be
interrogating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this would interfere with his probe, Danforth said,
``I'm not going to try to tell Congress what to do, or what not to
do, or what I think they should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the appointment, Reno said she had found the right
person for a tough job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to find someone with impeccable credentials,
someone with bipartisan support in Washington who is widely
regarded throughout the country, someone who is independent and
someone who has the wisdom and determination to do the job the
right way,'' she said. ``I have found that person in Senator John
Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a three-term Republican senator from Missouri, also
served as that state's attorney general and is an ordained
Episcopal minister.
