<HEADLINE> Danforth: Waco Probe To Cost $11M  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Working in secrecy protected by armed guards
and metal detectors, the independent investigator looking into the
FBI siege at the Branch Davidian compound expects to spend nearly
$11 million, interview up to 1,000 people and review 1.5 million
pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-page budget for the inquiry headed by former Sen. John
Danforth was obtained by The Associated Press from the Justice
Department through the Freedom of Information Act. It offers
previously unreported details of the investigation, which is being
conducted mainly in a suite of offices on the 15th floor of a
downtown St. Louis office building.
</P>
<P>
   The information becomes known just before a re-enactment that is
scheduled for Sunday at a Texas military base. Danforth's purpose
in seeking the field test is to determine whether flashes recorded
by the FBI's infrared camera at the Waco, Texas, compound could be
from gunfire, as survivors claim in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth refused interview requests Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth in September amid
criticism that followed revelations that the FBI, contradicting a
position it had taken for six years, used potentially incendiary
devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff on April 19, 1993.
David Koresh and about 80 followers died. Reno and the FBI deny any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth
said at the time of his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which Danforth was required to file within 60 days
of starting work, shows that his plan called for interviews of up
to 1,000 people -- everyone from Branch Davidians to the Pentagon's
Delta Force commandoes -- who had knowledge of events related to the
siege. Danforth anticipated his investigators would sift through
more than 1.5 million pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Office of Special Counsel) will examine all physical
evidence, including thousands of pounds of uncataloged physical
evidence located in large repositories in Waco,'' Danforth said in
the document.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also planned to analyze ''hundreds of hours'' of
video, audio and infrared tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The document made no specific mention of the re-enactment at
Fort Hood, about 30 miles southwest of Waco. But documents released
by lawyers in the case showed Danforth has hired Vector Data
Systems Inc., which specializes in the installation of intelligence
gathering systems, to act as his expert for the test.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth didn't speculate on how long his investigation would
take. He projected spending $9,704,106 through the end of the year.
He spent $1,062,598 in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When he agreed to the assignment, the former Republican senator
promised to try to get to the bottom of four issues: whether
government agents shot into the complex, the origin of the fire,
the extent of the military's involvement and whether there was a
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth set up headquarters in St. Louis, his hometown, along
with an office in Washington and one in Waco. About $3.3 million of
his budget will be used to rent, furnish and protect those offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Counsel is not listed among the tenants at
the 20-story building, which is across the street from Danforth's
law offices. Danforth estimated he would spend $145,670 to have
security guards greet visitors when they step off the elevator to
the 17,124-square-foot office on the 15th floor. A metal detector
similar to the ones used by airports is wedged between the security
desk and hallway. Those without approved business are whisked back
into the elevator and sent on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Federal protective service at the Washington office was expected
to cost $118,975. There was no such allocation for Waco since it
was in an already-protected post office building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Danforth expected to pay $1.2 million for contract
workers to scan documents into a computer system ''that will allow
attorneys and investigators rapid search and analysis capability.''
Danforth also planned to hire seven specialists such as forensics
experts at a cost of $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the work would be done by a staff of 17 lawyers --
including Danforth and his deputy, former U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
-- along with 17 full-time and 15 part-time postal investigators.
The postal inspectors are not funded through Danforth's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is not using Justice Department investigators to avoid
a conflict of interest, since the actions of FBI agents are under
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth and six of his top lawyers earn a U.S. attorney's
salary, $118,400 a year. He also has two non-postal inspectors, two
paralegals and 16 support people, bringing his total payroll to
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is the first person to wield powers spelled out in a
new set of Justice Department regulations adopted in the wake of
the June 30 expiration of the independent counsel statute. If
necessary, he is authorized to prosecute for federal crimes arising
from his investigation. He can also call a grand jury. Those costs
would not be covered in the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's investigation is expected to cost far less than some
recent investigations by independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr spent an estimated $47 million for the five-year
investigation of President and Mrs. Clinton and their associates.
In the 1980s, the office of independent counsel spent $48.5 million
for a six-year inquiry into the Reagan White House's alleged
arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and its secret war against the
communist-led government of Nicaragua.
