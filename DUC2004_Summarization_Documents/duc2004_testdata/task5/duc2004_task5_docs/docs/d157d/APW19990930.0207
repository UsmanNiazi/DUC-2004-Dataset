<HEADLINE> Danforth Hires Aide for Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special counsel investigating whether the  
government covered up aspects of the 1993 Waco siege appointed a 
deputy on Wednesday to head the inquiry's dealings in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	John Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri who is  
setting up investigative offices in St. Louis and Washington, named 
Stuart Levey as associate special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Levey, 36, a partner in the Washington law firm Miller, Cassidy,  
Larroca &AMP; Lewin, ``brings perspective and experience that will be 
important to our effort to conduct a first-rate investigation,'' 
Danforth said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Levey hiring is among several Danforth has made in recent  
weeks as he assembles his investigative team. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth earlier this  
month to head a new inquiry into the siege after the Justice 
Department and FBI were forced to recant six years of denials that 
potentially incendiary tear-gas projectiles were fired in the hours 
before the siege's fiery end. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate task force and the House Government Reform Committee  
have launched their own inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth has pledged to answer the ``dark questions'' of whether  
the government killed Branch Davidians during the standoff and then 
engaged in a cover-up. Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 
followers died during the fiery climax to the 51-day siege, some 
from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has denied that any shots were fired during the  
standoff. Reno and FBI officials insist the fire was started by 
Davidians inside the compound, not federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, who is using St. Louis as his base of operations, told  
The Washington Post this week that he has recruited a chief of 
staff, a team of 12 to 15 lawyers, and postal inspectors. Former 
U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd Jr. is Danforth's deputy in St. Louis.
