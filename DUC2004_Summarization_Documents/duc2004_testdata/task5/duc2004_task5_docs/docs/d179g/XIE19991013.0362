<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif was dismissed after two years, seven months
and 25 days in office during its second tenure.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif came into power for the second time when he took
oath on February 17, 1997 as Pakistan's top executive following
the general elections in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Sharif first assumed his premiership in November 1990 when the
then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan announced fresh polls after the
dismissal of the Pakistan People's Party-led government by using
his constitutional powers under the eighth amendment of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, even during his first tenure, Nawaz Sharif could not
complete three years in the office.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan's Constitution, the tenure of an elected
government is five years. However, since the inception of Pakistan
in 1947, not a single government has completed the five-year term.
