<HEADLINE> Reactions to Sharif's Verdict Mixed </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The verdict of guilty against
Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday met mixed
reactions from different political parties.
</P>
<P>
Javed Jabbar, advisor to Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf on Information and Media Development said that the trial
of Nawaz Sharif and other six accused was "most transparent" in
the recent memory and the government will fully respect the
judgment.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Terrorism Court No. One (ATC-1) awarded the deposed
prime minister life imprisonment on charges of hijacking and
terrorism while acquitting the co-accused.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict substantiates the government point of view that
courts are free when the accused is convicted and the same is also
true when remaining accused are acquitted," Javed Jabbar said
talking to press outside the court after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"This is yet another clear manifestation of the independence
and integrity of the Judiciary," Javed Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League (PML) criticized the
verdict and termed it "faulty."
</P>
<P>
"Nawaz Sharif has been wronged through this decision. He
deserves the same reprieve the six others got," Raja Zafarul Haq,
head of PML Central Coordination Committee, said, adding that the
decision "bares the intentions to oust Nawaz Sharif from the
political scene."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), another main
political party led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,said
the hijacking case verdict is "a setback for the military
government regime which had sought the death penalty against Nawaz
Sharif."
</P>
<P>
Sharif was the third Pakistani prime minister who had been
convicted. The country's first elected prime minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto was awarded death sentence in late 1970s on charges of a
murder. His daughter Benazir Bhutto was sentenced to five-year
jail term in her absence on corruption charges by Nawaz Sharif's
government.
