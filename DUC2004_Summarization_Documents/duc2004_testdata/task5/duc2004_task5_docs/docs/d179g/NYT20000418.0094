   NEW DELHI, India _ Pakistani prosecutors demanded the death
penalty Tuesday for Nawaz Sharif, the ousted prime minister,
appealing the life sentence given to him after he was convicted of
hijacking and terrorism on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the judge gave an appropriate explanation for
handing down a lower-than-maximum punishment to Nawaz Sharif,'' the
chief prosecutor, Raja Qureshi, told The Associated Press in
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pakistani law, hijacking is a capital offense, though a
judge can give a lesser sentence if circumstances warrant it. After
a criminal trial, the prosecution, like the defense, is entitled to
appeal both the verdict and the sentence to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   In Judge Rehmetullah Hussein Jaffri's 157-page decision two
weeks ago, he said a life term was sufficient punishment for Sharif
because the hijacking had been ``committed at the spur of the
moment and in heat of passion'' after Sharif ``came to know that
his authority was eroded by some few army soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who was ousted in a nonviolent military coup on Oct. 20,
was convicted of hijacking for temporarily ordering the diversion
of a Karachi-bound commercial plane. Among the 198 people aboard
was a man the prime minister had just fired a few hours before: the
army chief of staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   After the military took command and the general installed
himself as the nation's ``chief executive,'' he told the country
that Sharif and several conspirators had tried to kill him by
ordering the plane out of Pakistani air space when it was short of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The judge acquitted six co-defendants but said he considered the
former prime minister guilty of hijacking according to the penal
code's broad definition of that crime, assessing guilt to ``whoever
unlawfully, by the use or show of force or by threats of any kind,
seizes or exercises control of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have also appealed the not-guilty verdicts of the
co-defendants, all of whom remain in prison, facing corruption
charges or being held in the limbo of what is known as preventive
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has also appealed his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The various appeals will now be reviewed by a panel of the high
court of the province of Sindh.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sharif's lawyers, Khawaja Naveed, told reporters that the
prosecution is demanding a death sentence to make sure the former
prime minister never returns to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Naveed said that if Nelson Mandela, the former South African
president, ``can come to politics after 27 years imprisonment, then
why not Nawaz Sharif?''
