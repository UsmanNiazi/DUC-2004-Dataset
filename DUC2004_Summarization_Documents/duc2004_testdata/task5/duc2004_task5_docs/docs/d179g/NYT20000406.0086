FORMER PREMIER OF PAKISTAN IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Pakistan's former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who was deposed
by a military coup six months ago, was sentenced Thursday to life
in prison after he was convicted of terrorism and hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who was put on trial in a special anti-terrorism court
by the coup's leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was found guilty of
trying to stop a commercial airliner carrying Musharraf from
landing in Karachi Oct. 12, when the coup took place, thereby
endangering the lives of everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer any justice in Pakistan,'' Sharif said
after the verdict was announced, The Associated Press reported.
``Now my case rests with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, and his other supporters in the
courtroom vociferously protested the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a personal vendetta against my innocent husband, who has
not committed any crime,'' Nawaz was quoted as saying by Agence
France-Presse. ``A lion cannot be caged.''
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister was spared the death penalty usually
imposed in hijacking cases when the judge, Rehmat Hussein Jafri,
sentenced Sharif to two life terms in prison instead. Jafri also
declared Sharif's property forfeited and ordered him to pay a fine
equivalent to about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Jafri found Sharif not guilty of charges of kidnapping and
attempted murder. Six other defendants _ including Sharif's
brother, Shahbaz _ were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants asserted their innocence throughout the trial,
saying that it was being staged to give a veneer of legitimacy to
the coup's victors.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's lawyers said they would appeal both the verdict and his
sentence. The prosecutors said they would appeal his acquittal on
the kidnapping and attempted murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The overthrow of Sharif's democratically elected government and
his subsequent trial had triggered protests around the world, with
President Clinton nearly bypassing Pakistan during his tour of the
region last month. Clinton did make a one-day visit and appealed
for clemency for Sharif, which may have spared him from going to
the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, expressed
concern about how Sharif's trial was conducted, noting that judges
had been forced to take an oath of allegiance to the military
rulers and that Pakistan's anti-terrorism laws had been changed to
include hijacking after the event took place.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharif set up the special anti-terrorism courts last year to
combat rising crime and terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf contended that as prime minister, Sharif ordered that
the airliner carrying the general back from Sri Lanka be denied the
right to land in Karachi, thereby creating ``terror and
insecurity'' among the 198 passengers and crew members. The former
director of Pakistan's civil aviation authority, Aminullah
Chaudhry, testified for the prosecution in return for not standing
trial with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif had dismissed Musharraf as the army's chief of staff, but
the general later landed in Karachi after his troops took over the
airport. He made himself Pakistan's new leader, suspended its
constitution and detained the former prime minister.
