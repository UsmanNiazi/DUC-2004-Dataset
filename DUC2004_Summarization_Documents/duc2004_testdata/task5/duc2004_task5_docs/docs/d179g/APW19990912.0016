	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- After a weekend of violent  
anti-government protests and mass arrests in Karachi, the Pakistani 
government late Sunday announced the release of 200 imprisoned 
opposition leaders and activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghous Ali Shah, the chief executive of southern Sindh province,  
of which Karachi is the capital, said the release was meant as a 
goodwill gesture toward the opposition, which is demanding Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif dismissed the Sindh provincial government last year and  
imposed federal rule on the southern province, the stronghold of 
the ethnic based Muttahida Qami Movement and former prime minister 
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The MQM and Ms. Bhutto's party have joined a 19-party opposition  
alliance staging countrywide demonstrations to press their demand 
for Sharif's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif has imposed a two-month ban on demonstrations and strikes  
in southern Sindh province. However, the opposition has issued 
another strike call for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the people being released were arrested on Saturday in  
Karachi when police waged a bitter battle with opposition 
supporters trying to stage a rally. Hundreds of people were 
arrested at the rally. The opposition said 6,000 people were 
arrested, a charge denied by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hyderabad, about 70 miles north of Karachi, police and  
opposition supporters clashed Sunday after police stopped lawmakers 
from Ms. Bhutto's party from staging a sit-in and token hunger 
strike, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Hyderabad, a city of 3 million people, used water  
cannons and fired dozens of tear gas shells into the crowd and beat 
opposition supporters with iron-tipped sticks, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 people, including two lawmakers of Ms. Bhutto were  
arrested, said Naveed Qamar, a party spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nawaz Sharif continues to show the people . . . that he is a  
brutal, bloody dictator,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a statement from 
London, where she is living in self-imposed exile. ``The Nawaz 
regime is using a brutal force to suppress democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition accuses Sharif of corruption, favoritism and  
undermining the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif denies the allegations and says the opposition wants to  
destabilize the country.
