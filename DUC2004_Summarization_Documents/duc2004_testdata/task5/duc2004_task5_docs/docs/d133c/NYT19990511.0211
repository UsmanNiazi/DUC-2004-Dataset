HOMER MEETS DR. HAWKING  
 CALLING DR. GEIGER 
ARNETT'S NEW JOB

   Homer Simpson, the dunderheaded father on ``The Simpsons,'' is
renowned for his stupidity. Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge
University physicist, is renowned for his brains. On Sunday night
they met, fictionally speaking, when Hawking was a guest character
on the popular animated sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, who is nearly paralyzed and voiceless from the effects
of the degenerative muscular disorder known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, not only agreed to being written into the episode but
recorded his own lines as other voice-over guest stars do. His
``voice'' is expressed by a computerized synthesizer after he types
what he wants to say.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode, Lisa, the Simpsons' brainy daughter, joins the
Mensa Society, a club for geniuses; they overthrow the town
government and try to impose various improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course they go too far,'' said Matt Selman, one of the
show's writers. ``We needed someone smarter than them, someone they
could respect who could shame them into seeing the error of their
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer on the show, Larry Doyle, knew a relative of
Hawking and had been told that the famed physicist was a
``Simpsons'' fan.
</P>
<P>
   This is true. ``I think it's one of the cleverest shows on
television, and it always has a moral,'' Hawking said in a
statement he gave to Fox. He recorded his part last November while
on a visit to California.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scully, the show's executive producer, said, ``What I loved
was that it was a chance to have the world's smartest man and the
world's stupidest man get together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Hawking was a terrific sport,'' he said, ``even with jokes
that poked fun at himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer, being Homer, mistakes Hawking for another famous man in a
wheelchair. After Hawking scolds Lisa's gang, Homer says, ``Larry
Flynt is right, you guys stink!''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Hawking tells the Mensa maniacs: ``I don't
know which is a bigger disappointment _ my failure to formulate a
workable unified field theory, or you.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the school principal tries to explain what Hawking is
``trying to say,'' Hawking interrupts him and says: ``Silence! I
don't need anyone to talk for me _ except this voice box.''
</P>
<P>
   The robotic sound of the voice box could come from any such
machine, and Selman said that he had read Internet chat among
``Simpsons'' fans suggesting the show's producers had faked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was his computer you were hearing,'' Selman said. ``A
lot of the writers on the show are nerdy science guys anyway, and
we were in awe of him. He was unbelievably cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, according to the publicity statement, objected only to
his caricature. ``I'm not very flattered by my picture,'' he wrote,
``but it is fun.''

   Calling Dr. Geiger
</P>
<P>
   The wildly inventive mind of David E. Kelley was working
overtime as the television season drew to a close, not only because
he had to wrap up the seasons of ``The Practice'' on ABC and ``Ally
McBeal'' on Fox, but also because he stepped in at the last minute
to save his oldest surviving series, ``Chicago Hope'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley had ceased active participation in the production of that
medical drama several seasons ago, but when the series faced
imminent cancellation this spring, he went to CBS and offered his
services to try to regenerate interest in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a series finale, to be shown in two weeks, in
which Kelley effectively returns the show to its roots. He brings
back Mandy Patinkin as Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, puts him in charge of
the hospital and has him fire almost every cast member who has been
added since Kelley left the show.
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin, who won an Emmy for his work on ``Chicago Hope''
before a desire to spend more time with his family in New York led
him to quit the series, is close to a deal that will bring him back
for seven of the 13 episodes CBS is expected to order.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has agreed to write the opening episode of the season
next fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is in addition to his continuing work on both ``Ally'' and
``The Practice.'' Still another show, a new detective series for
ABC called ``Snoops,'' will also be under his production company,
though Kelley will not have day-to-day control over that one. He
did manage to write the pilot, and ABC executives are said to be
extremely enthusiastic about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice,'' meanwhile, ended the season with a stunner of
an episode that had several ABC executives calling it the best hour
of television they had seen all year. Kelley tied up several loose
ends from various cases, highlighted by a seasonlong decapitation
murder case for which he came up with an especially provocative
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kramer, the co-executive producer of both ``Ally' and
``The Practice'' said, ``I really feel like the fans were taken
care of in that episode.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Kelley had planned all season long to pull things
together in that way, Kramer said: ``I don't think David's mind
works that way, that far in advance. But who knows what goes on in
there?''

   Arnett's New Job
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks after his official departure from CNN, Peter
Arnett has found a new home for his international reporting, though
it's not on television.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the Internet. Arnett, who gained fame as CNN's reporter
on the spot during the air raids on Baghdad during the gulf war,
signed an agreement Tuesday with a newly launched Web site called
ForeignTV.com, which calls itself an Internet broadcaster
specializing in foreign news.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett has signed on to conduct a series of interviews with
world leaders for the service as well as to serve as an adviser to
the service in creating news bureaus in various locations.
</P>
<P>
   CNN settled Arnett's contract after effectively removing him
from the air in the wake of the scandal that became know as
Tailwind, after a report alleging that nerve gas was used by U.S.
military forces in Vietnam. The report by CNN was carried on its
news magazine program ``Newsstand.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was the correspondent for the report, which CNN
eventually retracted and apologized for showing.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's agent, Richard Liebner, said that he was still seeking
a traditional broadcast news position for Arnett but that this
seemed an ideal way for him to re-establish some of his foreign
reporting credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed to me like something that will allow Peter to
travel,'' Liebner said, ``to keep up his contacts, and get him
cooking again.''
