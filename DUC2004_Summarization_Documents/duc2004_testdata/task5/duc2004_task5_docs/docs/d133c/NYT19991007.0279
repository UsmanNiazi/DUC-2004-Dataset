   BOSTON _ You wondered, ``What was he thinking?'' when Mathew
Huggins, 16, tapped on his wheelchair-mounted computer and his
voice synthesizer spoke: ``Can I have your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   For the celebrity he addressed was physicist Stephen Hawking,
who lies twisted and nearly immobile in his electric wheelchair
while his towering intellect probes the universe. With his barely
controllable hands, writing is not even an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But little fazes the unstoppable Hawking, 57, who visited
Children's Hospital for a couple of hours Thursday to learn about
the latest in communications aids, and to do a little role-modeling
as well. Within minutes after Mathew's request, one of Hawking's
several assistants was handing out ``autographs'' _ cards bearing
photos of Hawking and his thumbprint _ to Mathew and other kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are impressed and moved and encouraged by (Hawking's)
achievements,'' said Mathew's mother, Katherine. So were the
parents of a half-dozen other children with impaired communications
who met with Hawking, in their wheelchairs and using a variety of
devices, both high-tech and low, to converse.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, a professor of physics and mathematics at Cambridge
University in England, has gained immense celebrity, written a
best-selling book, fathered three children, and done a huge amount
for the public image of disability.
</P>
<P>
   While at Children's Thursday, he toured the hospital's
Communication Enhancement Center. He was shown around by Howard
Shane, the director of the center, which evaluates assistive
technologies and helps children and adults find the most useful
devices to compensate for limited speech or writing because of
autism, cerebral palsy, language disorders, spinal cord injuries or
neuromuscular diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology has made it possible for even severely
disabled people to use some small movement _ a finger, a head
movement, even an eyeblink _ to select words or letters on a screen
to activate a speech synthesizer or log onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find some movement a person can control to use the
computer, then we're on our way,'' said Shane.
</P>
<P>
   Shane also said that in recent years, people who are diagnosed
with a degenerative disease that will ultimately silence them have
been recording their normal speech and putting the recordings into
a ``voice bank.'' This sampling of their healthy voice will make it
easier to synthesize natural-sounding speech.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the tour, Hawking asked for coffee. ``He's
feeling a little sluggish,'' said his wife, Elaine. Various
hospital staffers and members of his entourage scurried around to
procure it (black), get it to the right temperature and help him
drink it.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Shane pointed to a framed motto he thought
particularly relevant to Hawking. ``You don't need dexterity to
manipulate concepts,'' it read: the physicist typed for a few
moments and his synthesizer quipped, with perfect timing, ``Just
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawking developed Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), in his college years. He's been unable to speak
since undergoing a tracheostomy in 1985, but he has far outlived
the normal life expectancy of the disease, and he spends several
months of each year traveling and giving lectures and keeping up
with his work _ he publishes about 20 papers a year _ with the aid
of his speech synthesizer and a number of assistants.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 doctors, nurses, Children's employees and passersby
gathered around Hawking as he answered questions and gave a
kid-oriented mini-lecture on his specialties _ cosmology, the
theory of black holes, and the fate of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravity keeps the earth in its orbit,'' said Hawking through
his speech synthesizer. ``Otherwise it would wander off into
interstellar space, and things would get really, really cold.'' The
talk was pre-written and stored in Hawking's voice computer.
Answering a spontaneous question, however, meant a four- or
five-minute pause while the physicist scrolled through lists of
letters, words and phrases on a screen in front of him, selecting
them with a click of a switch held in his right hand, and
assembling them into a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking was to speak Thursday night at the Wang Center, and has
been in Boston for several weeks exchanging ideas with faculty and
students in Harvard's physics department.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Children's, Hawking switched from lecturer to
student. He received a personal briefing from Dr. Evan Snyder, a
researcher at Children's who believes that primordial ``stem
cells'' in the brain and nervous system can potentially be coaxed
into becoming nerve cells that could help people with diseases like
Hawking's to regain function.
</P>
<P>
   These primordial stem cells, said Snyder, choosing an analogy
that would appeal to Hawking, ``are the cells in which the Big Bang
in the brain took place.''
