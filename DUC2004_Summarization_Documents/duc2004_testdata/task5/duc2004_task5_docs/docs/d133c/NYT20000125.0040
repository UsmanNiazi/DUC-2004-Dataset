2 GREATEST ACTS IN THE UNIVERSE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I was hangin' with the Bangheads on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if that's what the devoted followers of Dr. Stephen
Hawking call themselves, but they should.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, Mr. Big Bang Theory, has devoted his life to solving
the mystery of how the universe started and where it's headed.
</P>
<P>
   He contracted Lou Gehrig's disease at 21 (he's now 57) and lives
in a wheelchair, his movements confined to twitches of a couple of
fingers. Hooked up to a computer, he uses those twitches to speak
in an electronic voice, and to write.
</P>
<P>
   Footnote: The mechanism that allows the world's smartest man's
thoughts to reach the outside world was created by a company in
Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Hawk was speaking at the Flint Center in Cupertino,
the 2,500 house was sold out, and from the desperate pleas of the
ticketless outside, you'd think Santana or the Foo Fighters was the
opening act.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about something that a frail, paralyzed man in
a wheelchair has people actually weeping and wailing when they find
out they can't buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me what Hawking said. I'm no cosmologist, though I do
style my own hair.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that at the time his disease was diagnosed and he was
given two years to live, he was bored with life. ``The prospect of
an early death concentrated my mind wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein once said, ``The human mind is not capable of grasping
the universe.'' But the 'Stein never met the Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking explained the quest to solve the riddle of the universe
in terms that any schlub with an IQ of 190 could easily grasp. He
chided Einstein a bit for rejecting the idea of random chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universe,'' Hawking said, ``is a giant casino with dice
being rolled or a wheel being spun at every occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope that doesn't mean we have to name the universe after
Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we incorporate the uncertainty principle into Einstein's
general theory of relativity,'' Hawking said, ``we're close (to
understanding the universe).''
</P>
<P>
   And I'm thinking, ``What do you mean,  &UR; `We?' '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But when it was over, I did remember where I parked my car.
</P>
<P>
   SAME NIGHT, the world's funniest man was cavorting in the
Mission, thus proving that the Bay Area is truly the center of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Hipsters packed the Mock Cafe on Valencia to check out a lineup
of local underground stand-up comics. It was $5 cover, BYOB, and
imagine everyone's surprise when Robin Williams jumped up and did
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some top comedians will do this kind of thing to try out
material for their act. Williams ain't got an act. He just gets up
and his brain makes like a tub of Jiffy Pop. It's the Big Bang
Theory of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   IF WE ALL POOL our brain cells, we'll figure out what to do with
the Doggie Diner head that has become such a political football.
</P>
<P>
   Let's bring Bush, Bradley, Gore and the boys into this debate.
The candidate who can make a gutsy, intelligent call on the Doggie
will be the front-runner to become America's top dog.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, though, a couple suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Morgana says let's put the Doggie head at Herb Caen Plaza,
in front of the Ferry Building, near a statue of Herb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the dogs at the entrance to Chinatown on Grant, the
Doggie can be rubbed for good luck. And Herb will forever have a
faithful companion.''
</P>
<P>
   THE 49ERS aren't going to the Super Bowl, but it's just as well.
They wouldn't want to be part of any major event that would have
the Rams as a participant.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers used to send their JV team out to whup the Rams. Them
were the days.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are the season's Cinderella story, but it took an NFL
official with a crowbar and tub of Vaseline to get that glass
slipper to fit.
</P>
<P>
   A replay official ruled ``no catch'' on a crucial pass caught by
a Tampa Bay receiver, and it was easily the worst call in the
history of football, amateur or professional.
</P>
<P>
   BUT WHO CARES about football, when baseball season has arrived?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants held spring training at their new ballpark Friday,
and Barry Bonds took batting practice without pulling a groin or a
hammie, or slipping a disc.
</P>
<P>
   Barrissimo hit a couple of kerplunkers, balls that soared
majestically over the Great Wall of China Basin.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Barry enjoyed himself. The final ball he hit into the
Bay, that was the last inside pitch Mr. Bonds will ever see in that
ballpark.
