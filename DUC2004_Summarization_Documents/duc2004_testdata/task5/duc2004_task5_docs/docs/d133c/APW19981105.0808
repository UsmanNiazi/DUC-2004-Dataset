Hawking chooses women and scientists as ``most important''
</HEADLINE>

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge theoretical
physicist who wrote ``A Brief History of Time,'' said Thursday that
women and scientists are the most important people of the 20th
century.
	   Hawking said that ``although I didn't admire many of her
policies,'' former prime minister Margaret Thatcher along with
geneticist Francis Crick and physicist Paul Dirac are among his
choices of Britons who best represented British life this century.
	   He was speaking at the National Portrait Gallery which has asked
10 men and women from the media, arts, fashion, science and
business to each choose 10 ``impressive quality'' photographs of
famous and unknown Britons for a ``Faces of the Century''
millennium exhibition in October 1999.
	   The panel has to try to cover each decade and consider who might
be remembered 100 years hence. It is now selecting its images.
	   Lord Sainsbury, grocery magnate and arts benefactor, said his
choices were all of writers and artists ``because over the
centuries they are the people who are best remembered.'' His named
first choice was writer Thomas Hardy.
	   Helena Kennedy, attorney and chairman of the British Council
which promotes British culture overseas, said a photo of
demonstrators against the Vietnam War is among her choices. Film
director David Puttnam picked a photo of 1930s fascist leader Sir
Oswald Mosley saluted by his blackshirts.
	   ``In present-day multiracial, multicultural Britain, the thought
of being sure that Britain won't slip back to that has to govern
everything we do,'' Puttnam said.
