SANTIAGO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Renowned British astrophysicist
Stephen Hawking today wound up his 11-day trip to Chile, which has
sparked a new wave of enthusiasm for scientific research in the
country's academic circle.
</P>
<P>
At a forum on black holes and the structure of the universe,
sponsored by the Santiago scientific research center, the
wheelchair-bound professor at Cambridge University gave a lecture
on the theory of black holes and universe, which secured him a
leading position in the field more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei and several ministers were among
the 4,000 audience to the lecture, given through a speech
synthesizer which Hawking controlled by tapping two fingers of his
right hand on his wheelchair-based computer.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hawking, 55, also flew to the Antarctic by a
cargo plane of the Chile's air force.
</P>
<P>
Hawking suffered from cerebral palsy at the age of 21 but has
continued successful researches in mathematics, physics and
philosophy.
