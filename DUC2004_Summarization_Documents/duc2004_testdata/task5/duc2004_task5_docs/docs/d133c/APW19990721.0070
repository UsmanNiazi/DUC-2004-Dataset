	POTSDAM, Germany (AP) -- Stephen Hawking remains confident that  
physicists will prove string theory -- a so-called ``theory of 
everything'' to explain the universe -- but said today it might take 
longer than he had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's best-known physicist, who was attending a conference  
on string theory, revised his prediction in the 1980s that there 
was a 50-50 chance the theory would be proven in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have made great progress in the last 20 years, we  
don't seem much nearer to our goal,'' he said. Hawking's odds on 
proving the theory are the same, but he now says it could take 
another 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If proven, string theory would unite the two main theories of  
physics: Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum 
theory. Scientists hope it will unlock the mysteries of black holes 
and the origins of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong annual conference, this year called ``Strings  
'99,'' is being held in Germany for the first time. The host is the 
Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics -- also known as the 
Albert Einstein Institute -- in the city of Potsdam, on the 
outskirts of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference site is just down the road from Einstein's summer  
home, where he spent his last years in Germany pondering a unifying 
theory for physics. The scientist never returned to his native 
country after an overseas trip in 1932, because friends warned him 
of the dangers he faced as a Jew under Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	Einstein continued work on a unified theory later at Princeton  
University, but never found a solution. In fact, said Hawking, a 
unified theory may not have a solution that is applicable all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be no theory that can be applied in different  
situations, just as there is no map that covers the entire world,'' 
he said, speaking through a computer attached to his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawking holds the Cambridge University post once held by Sir  
Isaac Newton and is the author of ``A Brief History of Time.'' Now 
57, he has suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, since his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing back at critics who say a unified theory will serve only  
scientists, Hawking said there will be a tangible benefit in 
solving humankind's deepest mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't understand the origin of the universe or why we are  
here,'' he said. ``A complete unified theory might not bring much 
material benefit, but it would answer that age-old question.''
