	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ Cambridge University received a dlrs
12.5 million gift from a Californian businessman to create a
science and technology library that will be home to physicist
Stephen Hawking's archives.
	   Gordon Moore, co-founder and former chairman of Santa
Clara-based Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips,
pledged the money to create what he hopes will be the most advanced
science library in Europe.
	   ``The University of Cambridge has a long history of doing
leading research into some of the most fundamental questions that
mankind can ask,'' Moore said. ``I find this exciting and uplifting
and am pleased to contribute where I can.''
	   Moore pledged the money through Cambridge's development office
in the United States.
	   Cambridge said the library would hold all of Hawking's papers
and electronic archive material, including an early draft of his
best-selling book, ``A Brief History of Time.''
	   Hawking, 56, is the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at
Cambridge, a post once held by Sir Isaac Newton.
	   Cambridge already houses the papers of Newton and Charles
Darwin.
