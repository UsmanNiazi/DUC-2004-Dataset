 &HT;    Physics in '99: Hawking now accepts acceleration of expansion
theory

   ATLANTA _ Cosmologist Stephen Hawking said Tuesday he now
accepts what scientists are calling a stunning breakthrough in
astrophysics _ evidence that the universe not only is expanding,
but that the expansion is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, speaking at a press conference in Atlanta, said he was
not sure of that when scientists announced last year they had hard
evidence the universe is flying apart at ever greater rates. But
after carefully checking the measurements, Hawking said he now
accepts them as correct.
</P>
<P>
   The finding has profound implications for our understanding of
the fate of the universe. Science magazine, one of the world's most
respected scientific journals, called the accelerating universe
finding the ``Breakthrough of the Year'' for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, 56, the Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge
University in England, has been regarded by some as Albert
Einstein's intellectual successor. He is in Atlanta this week for
the 100th anniversary meeting of the American Physical Society, and
will give a public lecture at 8:30 p.m. tonight at the Atlanta
Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, 56, suffers from Lou Gehrig's Disease, which affects
his motor skills, and speaks by touching a computer screen that
translates his words through an electronic synthesizers. He is the
author of the best-selling ``A Brief History of Time,'' in which he
explains his theories on black holes and time and space.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to another question, Hawking said there is not enough
known matter in the universe to halt its expansion, and the
universe may keep flying apart forever. The expansion began,
scientists say, some 15 billion years ago in the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   In response to other questions, Hawking said:
</P>
<P>
   _ No one single thing can stand out as the greatest development
in physics in the 20th century. ``It's a ridiculous question,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are still wide gaps in our understanding about the
universe, but he says there is a 50-50 chance that scientists will
develop a theory within the next 20 years unifying the four forces
of nature _ gravity, electromagnetism and the weak and strong
forces associated with atoms.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether humans will be able to travel back in time
and in another dimension in the 21st century, Hawking abruptly
answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   In other research presented Tuesday at the APS meeting,
physicist Dan Spergel of Princeton University said that an
accelerating universe suggests the existence of a cosmological
constant. It was first suggested by Einstein in 1917 but was later
discarded by him because it seemed impossible. He later said that
it was his greatest blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmological constant would represent a huge energy
reservoir which means that the universe of matter, which includes
everything from rocks and sand to stars and clusters of galaxies,
may be but the minor portion of creation.
</P>
<P>
   In another presentation, physicist Ernest Sternglass theorized
that the universe will reach a size 200 times its present radius,
and will neither fly apart into dead ashes, nor collapse into a
fiery point, allowing life to continue forever.
