	   LONDON (AP) _ Physicist Stephen Hawking, author of ``A Brief
History of Time,'' flew to Hollywood for a role in ``The Simpsons''
television series and managed to wow Bart, Homer and Lisa, a
British newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Hawking, who holds the Cambridge University post once held by
Sir Isaac Newton, plays himself, complete with ``supercharged
wheelchair'' and his distinctive electronic voice, reported The
Independent on Sunday.
	   Bart _ ``an underachiever and proud of it'' _ his father Homer
and sister Lisa were ``overawed'' by Hawking, the newspaper
reported.
	   ``He comes in to make a commentary on the universe as a whole
and intellectuals,'' producer Bonnie Patila, was quoted as saying.
``He plays himself _ it's a show that has to do with intellectuals
and we don't know anyone more intellectual than him.''
	   ``Everyone wanted to meet him,'' said Ms. Patila. ``We are all
huge fans _ he was great fun.''
	   Friends said the academic ``greatly enjoyed'' his Hollywood
experience and would like to get more acting parts, the newspaper
said.
	   Hawking flew to Hollywood last week to film the single episode,
which is to be broadcast in the spring.
	   The professor suffers from Lou Gehrig's Disease, which affects
the motor skills and he uses an electronic synthesizer to speak.
