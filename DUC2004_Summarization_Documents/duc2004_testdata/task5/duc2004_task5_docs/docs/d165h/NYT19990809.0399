CLINTON GIVES MEDALS AND COMPLIMENTS TO THE CARTERS

   ATLANTA _ President Clinton on Monday presented former President
Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn with the Medal of Freedom,
saying the Carters have ``done more good things for more people
than any other couple on the face of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Handing out the country's highest civilian award, Clinton set
aside the history of a relationship that has often been mutually
disappointing, and gave compliments to match in an evening ceremony
at the Carter Center here. He compared Carter to the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Mrs. Carter to Eleanor Roosevelt. In
response, a grinning Carter called the occasion ``one of the most
beautiful events of my life.'' And, he said, ``it's especially
meaningful to receive it from a leader who's pursued many of the
same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter, who touched the medal almost shyly as Clinton
slipped it around her neck, cried as she talked about her work in
eradicating guinea worm in small African villages, saying, ``That's
not work, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter offered Clinton some advice about life after the White
House and said that after he was voted out of office in 1980, ``We
left Washington in something of despair and embarrassment and
frustration. We didn't know what we were going to do, and I was
about your age. I found out from some friends at the CDC I still
had 25 years of life expectancy and what was I going to do with
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents also traded gentle jokes: Clinton laughingly
suggested that Carter might have sent Jody Powell down to Arkansas
to help him lose his first run for office, when he ran for Congress
in 1974. And Carter noted that after Clinton leaves the White
House, ``You'll be able to play golf without any telephoto lens
focusing on your stroke, but there is a downside; I understand
golfing partners don't give as many mulligans,'' or do-over shots,
to ex-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment also seemed to bring the Carter-Clinton
friendship full circle at a time when imagining the contours of a
life after the presidency is of special interest to Clinton. He was
Carter's state chairman in Arkansas when the Georgia governor ran
for president in 1976, and occasionally attended dinners and
briefings in the Carter White House.
</P>
<P>
   But relations became more difficult while Clinton was governor
of Arkansas, when hundreds of Cuban refugees who had come to the
United States in the Mariel boat lift rioted and broke out of their
resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Even after it became clear that that situation was likely to
hurt Clinton's chances for re-election, the Carter administration
reneged on a promise that no more Cubans would be sent to Arkansas.
Instead, camps in several other states were consolidated and all
their refugees sent there.
</P>
<P>
   Later, not long after winning the 1992 presidential race,
Clinton asked Carter, who was eager to discuss foreign policy with
him, to instead deal directly with his secretary of state, Warren
Christopher, who did not return his phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   A week before Clinton's inauguration in 1993, Carter gave an
interview to The New York Times in which he said he was ``very
disappointed'' in the Clintons' decision to send Chelsea to an
exclusive private school and recalled how much his own daughter,
Amy, had enjoyed attending Washington's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also ventured that Clinton had been turned out of the
Arkansas Governor's Mansion in 1980 not because of the rioting
refugees but because voters wanted to bring him ``down a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, some in the Clinton circle indulged talk of
un-inviting the Carters to the inaugural festivities. The way the
Clintons ignored the Carters when they did appear for the
celebration was hardly less of a snub, according to Mrs. Carter,
who told Douglas Brinkley, author of The Unfinished Presidency:
Jimmy Carter's Journey Beyond the White House, ``It was rude beyond
belief. Not even Reagan would have done a thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when tensions with North Korea over its nuclear program
were running high, Carter successfully intervened, but embarrassed
the Clinton administration in the process. North Korea had for some
time been producing plutonium potentially adaptable to nuclear
weapons, and while insisting it was pursuing peaceful purposes,
eventually withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   With North Korea refusing to allow international inspectors to
do their job and the United States pushing for sanctions, Clinton
approved Carter's plan to accept an invitation to go there _ but
with the explicit understanding that he was doing so as a private
citizen. In North Korea, Kim Il Sung told Carter that in exchange
for help in getting modern light-water reactors for his country, he
would agree to a nuclear freeze, outside inspections and re-entry
into the non-proliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But then Carter infuriated Clinton officials by immediately
going on CNN to announce that an end to the crisis was at hand,
automatically limiting Clinton's options. And though North Korea
did later sign an agreement halting its nuclear program, pundits
debating which American president was calling the shots for a time
credited ``Jimmy Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Carter weighed in on the Lewinsky scandal, saying he
had ``deplored and been deeply embarrassed by what occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Carter could hardly have been more grateful, or
Clinton more laudatory, praising Carter's work on human rights and
on the Middle East peace process, as well as his record on hiring
women and minorities in his administration and on promoting peace
around the world since leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mrs. Carter will ``always be remembered as a pioneer on
mental health and a champion of our children.'' Working together,
he said, ``In many ways, this center has been their ministry.''
