<HEADLINE> Democrats Honor Ex-President Carter  </HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jimmy Carter hadn't planned to attend the
Democratic National Convention, even though his presidential status
made him an automatic delegate and Al Gore pressed him to make a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But then the vice president came back with a more appealing
offer -- a video tribute Monday night to the only surviving former
Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to worry about details of a speech,'' he said in
an interview with The Associated Press. ''Now I can enjoy the
convention with my children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter mingled among the Georgia delegates on the convention
floor ''with my friends'' before he and his wife, Rosalynn, slipped
unannounced into a VIP section prior to his tribute.
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced Carter to the crowd,
who reciprocated with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-minute video showcased Carter's accomplishments as
president and peacemaker. The audience cheered throughout several
spots, particularly during the footage of the signing ceremony for
the Camp David peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to be associated with my name, maybe the words
peace and human rights. That would be my preference,'' Carter said
at the conclusion of the video.
</P>
<P>
   During the tribute, Carter smiled broadly and his wife appeared
to be blinking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton later paid tribute to Carter during his
convention address, saying that ''in the great tradition of
President Jimmy Carter ... we are still the world's leading force
for human rights around the world. Thank you, President Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he ''really appreciated'' the acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was heartwarming to me,'' he said on CNN's Larry King Live.
</P>
<P>
   Following the tribute, Carter received a call from Gore, who
''just thanked me for being here and congratulated me.'' Carter
called the vice president ''a very close personal friend of mine
for 25 years,'' explaining that Gore was elected to Congress the
same year he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Carter lost his re-election bid to Ronald Reagan in 1980. His
term was marred by an energy shortage, skyrocketing inflation, and
the Iran hostage crisis but also included several highlights,
including the successful 1978 Camp David summit when he helped
hammer out a Middle East peace deal between Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the White House, Carter's popularity has increased
along with his reputation as a globe-trotting diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates criticized the Democratic Party for failing to
recognize Carter during previous conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's long overdue to pay tribute to President Carter,'' said
Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Carter's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was ''treated like a pariah at earlier conventions,''
said fellow Georgia delegate, former Rep. Buddy Darden.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never have felt excluded and I never have been treated
poorly,'' he said. ''I've always felt that I've been treated quite
well'' by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two conventions where he was nominated as president,
Carter made several other prime-time convention speeches. He said
he decided against going to the 1996 gathering because President
Clinton and Gore were being renominated.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't need my help,'' he said.
