   NEW YORK _ Jimmy Carter was 56 when he lost his job, and with a
life expectancy of another quarter-century, he was suddenly
confronted with a vexing question: What to do with the rest of my
life?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never thought about retirement much. It's hard to have
exalting ambition after leaving the White House,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Plains, Ga., a farming hamlet with ``600
neighbors,'' Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, ``went through a
careful analysis about what we had learned, what our interests
were. We considered our frustrated dreams from earlier in life, and
we began to explore different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, of course, spent the next 18 years as one of the most
vigorous former presidents in history, mediating international
conflicts, monitoring elections, channeling aid to the Third World,
building homes for Habitat for Humanity, teaching, and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Now his 13th book, ``The Virtues of Aging,'' is just out. Part
of the Library of Contemporary Thought series by the Ballantine
Publishing Group, it is a call for older people to turn their
retirement years to useful purpose. Carter expanded on the theme in
an interview yesterday as he set out on a book-signing tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virtues of Aging,'' Carter said, rebuts the suggestion by
former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm that the elderly should make way
for younger generations and not try to extend their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slouching into retirement, Carter says those who are
preparing to leave the work force should ask themselves the same
sort of questions he and his wife asked themselves in the winter of
1980. ``Do you still have an interest in life? Do you still
exercise? Do you still grow a garden? Do you still ride a bike? Do
you still go bowling? Do you still read books?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any recommendations for President Clinton, who
will be only 54 if he completes his term, Carter said: ``I think
President Clinton should do whatever he chooses. He's a lawyer. I'm
not. He was a professor at the University of Arkansas when I first
met him. I'm in my 16th year as a professor, teaching six hours a
month. He could be a full-time professor. He's eloquent and
intelligent; he could write books. He might want to run a
foundation to explore different interests he didn't complete as
president. He and his wife, together, could have an unlimited
opportunity to do challenging things.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary citizens, Carter advises voluntarism and an active
schedule. As he writes in the book, ``Why not expand our sights
instead of restricting our lives and accepting the lowest common
denominator of a dormant existence?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's mother, known as ``Miss Lillian,'' dramatized this
approach by joining the Peace Corps when she was 68 and maintaining
a busy lifestyle until her death at 85.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is 74, yet looks as fit as he did when he pitched for a
softball team that beat up on a squad of reporters almost every
afternoon during that magical summer of 1976 he captured the
Democratic nomination and went on to win the White House. He is
accomplished at fly-fishing and learned to ski when he was 60. He
and his wife play tennis and jog regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to retire, the former president is turning to a new
intellectual pursuit, a novel set during the Revolutionary War.
``It starts off in Philadelphia, then moves to North Carolina and
then to Georgia,'' he says. ``The main character is located 30
miles west of Augusta where, coincidentally, my ancestors lived.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure historical accuracy, Carter is reading extensively
about the Revolution. ``It puts me back in college,'' he says. ``I
went back to college, in fact, to learn to write poetry as an
off-campus student'' a few years ago. ``I was assigned books to
study. I'm doing the same thing now with creative writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is not ready to reveal the book's title, but believes he
will become the first president to produce a novel.
</P>
<P>
   His 71-year-old wife, a partner in many of his activities,
collaborated with him on one book, ``Everything to Gain: Making the
Most of the Rest of Your Life.'' Carter vows he will never do that
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We undertook the book with full anticipation that it would
bring us together. But, seriously, it was the closest we came to
separating,'' he says, remembering the project with a frown. ``When
you have two strong-willed people, you can agree on 98 percent, but
the other 2 percent becomes paramount. Our memories were different.
I had vivid memories of our first date; her recollection was quite
different. It got to where we couldn't communicate except by
writing ugly notes back and forth on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Their editor, Peter Osnos, finally brokered the disagreement by
deciding whose versions of their life together would wind up in the
book. ``Some paragraphs have an `R' by them, others have a `J',''
Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virtues of Aging'' is pure Jimmy. With its quaint
aphorisms and upbeat philosophy, it is a testament to the values of
work, love, and religious faith and reminiscent of the little
campaign book that launched his presidential campaign, ``Why Not
the Best?''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he approaches the prospect of failing health and the
inevitability of death, Carter shows no signs of slowing down and
says he has no sense of depression. The oldest of four children, he
has outlived his siblings, who all died from pancreatic cancer.
``That was the most negative part of my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Camp David Treaty, signed 20 years ago, is his
legacy, Carter prefers to talk about his accomplishments as an
older man. ``We've been remarkably gratified by life in Plains. In
July, Rosie and I led the effort to bring the black and white
communities together by building two swimming pools, a bathhouse, a
basketball court, and a recreation center. It was inundated with
children, white, black and Mexican kids,'' he said, and his face
crinkled with his famous smile, still toothy after all these years.
