<HEADLINE> Carter Describes Mozambique's Elections as "Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter who is leading 50 observers in Mozambique, said here Monday
that the Mozambican electoral process has been "overwhelmingly
free and fair".
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center set up by Carter had an observation mission
during the second multi-party general elections in the southern
African country at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The observers from 16 different countries visited about 650
polling stations in all 11 of the country's provincial
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the 1994 elections had been largely organized by the
United Nations, "this time it's a successful product of the people
of this country, " Carter said.
</P>
<P>
He regarded as "highly successful" the conduct both of the
voter registration in the July-September period and now the
elections themselves.
</P>
<P>
Carter said that Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the main opposition
 Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), did not repeat his
Sunday's allegation that "electoral fraud" is being prepared.
</P>
<P>
The correct behavior of an opposition party that suspected
fraud would be "to file an official complaint with the evidence,"
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the observers have so far not come across any
evidence of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Counting took place at the polling stations on Sunday night.
Provincial results should be announced by December 12, and a week
later the National Elections Commission must announce the final
results.
</P>
<P>
Carter said that some of the observers would stay on to watch
the provincial count and the final tabulation of the results.
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center estimated voter turnout at over 70 percent,
with rates of 80 percent in some polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Carter also said the observers were impressed by "the large
number of women polling staff, and of women voters", noting that
"quite often the polling station chairperson was a woman."
