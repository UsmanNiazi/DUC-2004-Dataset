<HEADLINE> Jimmy Carter: One-China Policy Must Be Carried on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter has reiterated the importance of the one-China policy
decided upon when Washington and Beijing established diplomatic
relations 20 years ago, hoping the stance will be carried on.
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview with Xinhua, Carter said he
noticed that after Lee Teng-hui announced the "state-to-state
relations" with the Chinese mainland, the Clinton administration
reaffirmed its policy "on the fact that there is only one China
and Taiwan is a part of China."
</P>
<P>
This is "the same policy I enunciated 20 years ago," which has
since remained unchanged, added Carter, who saw the normalization
of the U.S.-China relationship during his term.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this (policy) will continue," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Carter believed that the U.S. and other nations
would do everything they can to protect the one-China principle
and avoid any conflict in that region.
</P>
<P>
The former president expressed the hope that Taiwan's leaders
would "never contradict the basic promise on which the American
and Chinese diplomatic relations are grounded."
</P>
<P>
Carter also voiced his hope that China would soon be admitted
into the World Trade Organization so that it could become "a much
more active player" in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president said he is "optimistic" about the
future U.S.-China relations, because the people and leaders of the
two countries have come to see the greatest advantages if they
communicate, understand and cooperate with each other.
</P>
<P>
And the whole world would like to see the United States and
China stand side by side for global economic progress, world peace
and regional stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who first came to China as a submarine serviceman in
the spring of 1949, said he found "remarkable changes in many ways
" when visiting China again in 1981 at the invitation of the then
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Carter traveled to China for the second time in July 1997 for
cooperation in improving elections in China's rural areas under
the China Village Elections Program sponsored by the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
"We got excited to observe elections in many of the villages,"
he said. "In some cases, it's a very successful experiment, and in
some cases there still needs some uniformity about the process,"
Carter commented.
</P>
<P>
Carter, whose birthday happens to fall on October 1, the
National Day of the People's Republic of China, said that the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once joked to him: "You are brought
together with China because we have the same birthday."
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud to associate my own celebration with that of
your country," Carter told Xinhua in the interview.
