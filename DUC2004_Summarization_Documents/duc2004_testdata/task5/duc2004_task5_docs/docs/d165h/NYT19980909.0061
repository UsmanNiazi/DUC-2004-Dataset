   THE UNFINISHED PRESIDENCY, by Douglas Brinkley. Viking; 586
pages; $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   To many minds, Jimmy Carter is the best ex-president in history.
That may underestimate John Quincy Adams, who received his
posthumous due in ``Amistad,'' but folks who didn't much like him
as president but love him as an ex probably don't know the half of
Carter's late career.
</P>
<P>
   That gap is admirably filled by Douglas Brinkley, a historian at
the Eisenhower Center of the University of New Orleans. Still, most
readers will decide they'd rather admire Jimmy Carter than be him.
</P>
<P>
   He's known for work with Habitat for Humanity, which builds
housing for low-income families, which goes beyond photo
opportunities to honest sweat, as well as for quixotic peacemaking
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not know how much Carter's moral suasion had to do
with Daniel Ortega's accepting the results of the Nicaraguan
election that deposed him. And they may not know just how many
elections he has monitored (17) or that he's responsible for
distributing medications for preventing river blindness to more
than 11 million people as well as nearly eradicating several
diseases, and winning freedom for political prisoners, 50,000 of
them by rough count.
</P>
<P>
   He's also written a fat, dry memoir of his presidency and
breezy, interesting books on the Middle East, elections, religion
and fishing. Wife Rosalyn has written a book (on growing old) with
him and others on her own. There is life after Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of peace, he buddied up to Yasser Arafat; the late
mad dictator of North Korea, Kim Il-sung; the clueless communist
Ortega; Haitian bully Raoul Cedras; and indicted war criminal
Radovan Karadzic of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he has been effective. We occupied Haiti without
bloodshed when he talked Cedras into going. A boat ride with Kim
Il-sung may have averted the second Korean war. But none of his
solutions have been permanent, and sometimes he just got in the
way, as in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In his own book, Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton
peace accord, tells how Karadzic tried to cash in on his relations
with Carter. Holbrooke snapped back that Bill Clinton is president,
not Jimmy Carter. Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic (no sweet
guy himself) thanked Holbrooke privately. Karadzic, he said, tried
to play the Carter card with him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Officials constitutionally responsible for foreign policy have
tried different ways to keep Carter in the corral. George Bush's
secretary of state, Jim Baker, used frequent phone calls and
briefings. Clinton's first secretary, Warren Christopher, cut
Carter off completely even though he had been Carter's personal
attorney and Carter lobbied to get him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Their problem was not only that they never knew what Carter was
saying to thugs, but that he had a bad habit of announcing deals to
the CNN crew Ted Turner sends everywhere with him before telling
Washington what was in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see that as grand-standing. Carter may see it as
ensuring that the deal is known before the boffins at the White
House and State Department spin it away.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley records all of this at a steady pace without bogging
down in psychology. His historical approach puts a load of
interpretation onto the reader. This reader, anyway, felt sympathy
for presidents and secretaries of state on the sidelines of some of
Carter's excellent adventures, even when Carter had logic on his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the man is single-minded, impervious to advice and
needlessly offensive toward the good guys. When he sups with the
devil, he uses a short spoon and flicks soup at the angels.
</P>
<P>
   That is the opposite of politics. Lack of charm may make him
effective in his new field, but soft soap has its uses, especially
in reaching long-term results.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart enough to know that, so a reader begins to suspect he
can't help himself. He is lashed to his grindstone of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley had access without censorship, but the only Carter
humor in more than 400 pages is a quip with a purpose. Sudan's
dictator was resisting the Carter Center's plan to bring in a
program to eradicate guinea worm, a painful, prolonged condition in
which worms grow in sufferers' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guinea worm in Guinea,'' Carter said, ``and we
have decided to name the worm after the country that is the last to
finish eradicating the disease. We don't want to have to call it
Sudan Worm.'' The point was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has had a busy and fruitful late career. But the nearest
he seems to come to joy is grim satisfaction in his duty as he sees
it despite any and all setbacks. It's a personality we've seen
before _ in Sisyphus.
