<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Carter Top U.S. Award </HEADLINE>

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton looked a bit startled when his  
only living Democratic predecessor, Jimmy Carter, talked 
enthusiastically about the time ``in a few months'' when Clinton 
will join the small fraternity of ex-presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who last year called the Monica Lewinsky impeachment  
scandal an embarrassment, received the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom from Clinton in a ceremony Monday at the human rights 
organization Carter established after leaving the White House 
nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But before Clinton clasped the medal around his neck, Carter  
ribbed Clinton about the not-too-distant future, when Clinton can 
play golf unmolested by news cameras -- ``Isn't that great?'' Carter 
exclaimed ---- and work on setting up his own namesake library or 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning serious, Carter said he left the White House at about  
the same age Clinton will be when he leaves office after the 2000 
elections, and was at a loss as to his next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``We left Washington in something of despair, and embarrassment,  
disappointment and frustration,'' Carter said as he looked out at 
an audience that included many of his former staff, including press 
secretary Jody Powell and chief of staff Jack Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had come to praise Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, as  
partners in peace and democracy, and to award them each the 
nation's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke admiringly of the Carters' partnership in and out of  
the White House, and called Carter a man of peace who used his 
retirement from politics to help poor people at home and promote 
democracy abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have done more good things for more  
people in more places than any other couple on the face of the 
Earth,'' Clinton said during a brief tribute at the Carter Center, 
which works to improve health and sends observers to monitor 
elections worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the 39th president, was recognized for brokering the  
Camp David peace accords, signing the Panama Canal treaty and 
re-establishing normal diplomatic relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carter was recognized for work to improve mental health  
care and childhood immunization, women's equality and enhanced care 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also noted the Carters' work helping to build  
homes for the needy through Habitat for Humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration has sometimes bridled at Carter's  
freelance diplomacy efforts, and had to endure Carter's blunt 
assessment of Clinton's situation as the impeachment drama neared 
its end late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an embarrassment. I hope it's over soon,'' Carter said in  
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter added that in his own election in 1976, ``people were  
looking for a candidate who wouldn't lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will make the same award to former President Gerald Ford  
and seven other people at a separate ceremony in Washington on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, a Republican who was the 38th president, will be  
recognized for ``his honesty and integrity'' and his efforts to 
restore confidence in government after the Watergate scandal led to 
Richard Nixon's resignation, the White House said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other living former presidents, both Republicans, Ronald  
Reagan has received the award and George Bush has not. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton awarded the medal earlier this year to Former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former Sen. George Mitchell, who helped 
broker a peace deal in Northern Ireland.
