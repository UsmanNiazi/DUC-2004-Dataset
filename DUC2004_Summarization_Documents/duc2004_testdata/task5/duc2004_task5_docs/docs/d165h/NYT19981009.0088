   In the last several weeks, while Bill Clinton has faced the
greatest moral crisis of his presidency, Jimmy Carter has built a
recreational complex for the children of Plains, Ga., promoted his
ambitious plan to bring democracy to China one village at a time,
received a visit from the former president of Nigeria and taught a
Sunday school class on the subject of personal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some carefully worded comments last month
at Emory University -- in which the former president demonstrated
disgust for President Clinton's affair and lack of honesty with the
American people and in which he predicted Clinton would survive
impeachment hearings -- Carter has remained mostly silent about
Clinton's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is often the case, regular students in his Sunday
school class at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains were the first
to get a hint of just what Carter is thinking about national
events.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been the regular adult Sunday school teacher at
Maranatha for the last 16 years. He teaches an average of three
times a month, beginning each hour-long class with a 10-minute
update on personal events or observations relating to the
activities in his own life in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, he has made several observations regarding the
Lewinsky affair and the campaign-finance investigation now
surrounding Vice President Al Gore:
</P>
<P>
   --The Sunday after Congress released President Clinton's taped
grand jury testimony, Carter told his class he had spoken that week
with former president Gerald Ford, ``who has evolved into a very
deep and personal friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we discussed this week was the crisis now in
Washington, Carter said. We agreed to not speak out in public about
what should happen, but we both deplore the crisis and the moral
problem of our nation. We constrasted it with when we happened to
be in office, and we agreed to just consult with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   --In addressing his class just a few days after Clinton's Aug.
17 admission, Carter spoke about his visit to the ``Tonight Show''
with Jay Leno after he wrote ``Living Faith'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preparation for my visit to the show, he (Leno) interviewed
people on the street to see what they knew about the Bible. It was
surprising how many people knew the first commandment was freedom
of speech, and a lot of them knew the whale swallowed Pinnochio,''
Carter told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one that modern-day leaders should remember involves the
seventh commandment. I'm not going to name any names, but they
thought it said, ``thou shalt not ADMIT adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   --In early September, Carter told his class, ``One thing I did
this week was to call Al Gore, who is a friend of ours, and give
him some advice on how to deal with the charges against him that he
might have used improper means to raise funds for the last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I hoped that no matter what he did, that if he
made a mistake that he should just admit it and say, 'I made a
mistake. My lawyers advised me to do this.' and not get caught
later on in having told the American people something that wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened carefully and began to tell me his lawyers advised
that this was technically correct. And I said, 'Look Al, I don't
even want to hear that. You just tell the worst that you possible
could have done, and let the American people be on your side.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure would hate to see Al Gore get caught up in a situation
where people would doubt his honesty and his integrity. I think Al
Gore is a very honest and decent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's obvious omission of comment on Clinton was not lost on
anyone in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the contrasts between Clinton's moral quotient and
Carter's is not lost on anyone who remembers the 1976 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's ``I'll-never-lie-to-you'' promise seemed almost naive
at the time but stands in total contrast with Clinton's public lie
in January, ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lead in the 1976 pre-election polls vanished when
``Playboy'' reported that he had admitted having lusted for women
other than his wife Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   This is mild stuff when compared to the thousands of
near-pornographic pages released in the last four weeks related to
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was voted out of office by Americans who considered him
ineffective in his efforts to reduce double-digit inflation and to
reclaim our hostages from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   After he lost his bid for re-election, Carter was consoled by
people who told him he was too good a man, too honest a human
being, to be in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now is tagged untrustworthy, morally repugnant, ``but an
effective president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carter has remained restrained in his public comments on
the moral crisis in Washington, he does offer a profound example of
redemption after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton should start taking notes.
