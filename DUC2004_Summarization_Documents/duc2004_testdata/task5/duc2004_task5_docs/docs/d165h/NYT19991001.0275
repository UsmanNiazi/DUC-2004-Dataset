birth

<P>
   PLAINS, Ga. _ On his 75th birthday Friday in the place where he
was born, former President Jimmy Carter was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   He grinned broadly as schoolchildren serenaded him with ``Happy
Birthday'' at the national historic site that bears his name. He
beamed as celebrities such as Pat Boone, the Indigo Girls, the
McGuire Sisters and Sam Donaldson of ABC News honored him during a
black-tie birthday party in nearby Americus, where a giant birthday
cake blocked a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   The state's most prominent resident and Georgia's 76th governor
seemed happiest, though, when he talked about his enduring
relationship with his neighbors in Plains, a southwest Georgia town
of 712 people. It's a hometown that has repeatedly sent him off to
wage political battle and, more important, has always welcomed him
home _ win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been overwhelming,'' Carter said of the affection he
has felt in Plains as his milestone birthday approached. ``The
friendship and support, I have to say, are typical of what the
folks around here have always extended to me...''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intimacy with which I grew up as a boy here among these
same folks has been continued and even expanded,'' he said during a
private interview at the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, the
former Plains High School. ``Our life has been here in Plains. This
has always been my home.''
</P>
<P>
   For James Earl Carter Jr., who studied nuclear physics but would
rather describe himself as a peanut farmer, Plains has always
served not just as hometown, but as metaphor. It is a simple,
straightforward place that gave the country a simple,
straightforward man as its 39th president.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he became a citizen of the world, monitoring
elections and fighting war and poverty in developing nations across
the globe since he left the White House almost 19 years ago, Jimmy
Carter has remained a citizen of Plains. That means a lot to the
others who live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves this community,'' said Rudy Hayes, who came to the
historic site to wish his old friend happy birthday Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Plains, where Carter's 1976 presidential campaign
headquarters still dominates the small downtown and artifacts like
a giant peanut with a toothy smile still dot the landscape,
``everybody likes Jimmy Carter,'' Hayes said. ``Even people who a
long time ago may not have liked him politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering his fourth quarter-century, Carter seems to have made
peace with his political enemies, in Plains and elsewhere. He said
he consults frequently with former President Gerald Ford, whom he
defeated in 1976, on ways to repair what he called the ``really
sad'' state of American politics. He spoke wistfully of how he and
former President Ronald Reagan, who denied Carter a second term in
1980, referred to each other as ``my distinguished opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter would like to diminish money's influence on political
campaigns. But he is a realist: ``Obviously a former president
can't be too directly influential over what the Congress does.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he spends much of his time on the work of the Carter
Center, helping ``people and countries ignored by the rest of the
world.'' That work, he said, has given him a wisdom he lacked as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a much greater insight into the ambitions and the
family values and the initiatives that ignored people have within
them,'' he said. ``And also the suffering that they have to endure
with unnecessary wars and with poverty and hunger and lack of
shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he added, ``I understand how much the
United States could do to alleviate suffering and prevent wars that
I didn't understand when I was president.''
</P>
<P>
   His 75th birthday, Carter said, has prompted him to reflect not
just on his place on the world stage, but also in Plains. It is, he
pointed out, the only place in America that is the hometown of both
a president and a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our families, who were born in the 1700s, are buried here, and
we own the same land that we've had since the Indians left,'' he
said. ``Our churches have been the foundation for our lives. This
building _ Rosalynn and I both went all our elementary and high
school years here. Our three boys did the same. Even Rosalynn's
mother went here. She's 94 years old now.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can see our ties are very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   The birthday party _ at the recently restored Rylander Theatre
in Americus, 12 miles east of Plains _ further tweaked Carter's
reminiscing. The Rylander was an important part of his childhood,
providing the only glimpse of a world beyond the peanut and cotton
farms that surrounded Plains and Americus.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he would work late _ 9:30 or 10 _ at his uncle's
store in Plains on Saturday nights, then get a ride to Americus to
see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often with a date from Plains,'' he added. ``Or
sometimes I'd meet an Americus girl over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``most momentous event'' of those years, he said, was when
``Gone With the Wind'' opened at the Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   ``School turned out,'' he said, ``and they hauled us to the
theater in buses so they could make sure everybody saw `Gone With
the Wind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Plains and Americus have changed little since those days, he
said, except in one important way.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Carter recalled, he and African-American playmates
from the Archery community outside Plains would want to see movies
together at the Rylander. They could walk to the train station in
Plains together, but ``we had to sit in different parts of the
train'' to Americus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'd get to Americus at the railroad station and we'd
walk together to the theater,'' he said. ``Then my playmates would
go upstairs to the third floor, and I would go to the bottom
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused a moment, thinking about his 75th birthday party in
the same building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``everybody will be sitting everywhere.''
