   MODESTO, Calif. _ Although he had not heard from his wife for
the better part of two days, Jens Sund of Eureka was so confident
of her resourcefulness and reliability that he played a round of
golf before he realized that something was definitely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how unworried I was,'' a chastened, exhausted Sund said
Monday. ``Now, I'm worried as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Carrington Sund, his wife of 21 years, ``did not do
things spontaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is treating the disappearance of Carole Sund, 42, their
daughter Julie, 15, and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a family friend from
Cordoba, Argentina, as a possible kidnapping. They have not been
seen since they left their motel in El Portal, on the edge of
Yosemite National Park, on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say they have no hard evidence of foul
play. But they do have Carole Sund's wallet, found Friday on the
median strip of a busy Modesto street by a teen-age girl. It
contained her driver's license and several credit cards, but the
cash was missing. Sund said his wife had withdrawn $200 from an ATM
in Merced the previous Sunday and probably carried hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' Sund, 43, said with resignation as he
patiently gave interviews _ in Spanish and English _ at a motel in
Modesto, half a mile from where Carole Sund's wallet was found.
</P>
<P>
   Because the safe return of his wife and the two girls may still
be possible, Sund has offered a $250,000 no-questions-asked reward
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund is a principal in Eureka-based Carrington Co., which
owns shopping centers in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada,
Oregon, Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, the Carringtons, has been prominent in Sonoma County
real estate development for more than a century. Jens Sund is a
vice president of Carrington Co. His wife has her own independent
business as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said he had received no calls hinting at a ransom demand.
</P>
<P>
   Mariposa County sheriff's Sgt. Doug Binniweiss, the lead
investigator in the case, said Carole Sund's wallet was being
examined by the FBI, but declined to say if fingerprints or other
evidence had been found on it.
</P>
<P>
   Search teams combed the highways leading into Yosemite and the
roads within it on foot and snowshoe, and scanned the area from the
air in helicopters and planes, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The red 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix, California license plate
4BMV025, which Carole Sund rented from Avis, has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   If it were still in the Yosemite area, ``we would have located
it by now,'' Binniweiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said the family had never received threats or even any
hints that they might be targeted for a crime. Carole Sund had been
active ``in a very low-key way'' as a volunteer schoolteacher in
parenting classes and other programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund discounted a radio report Monday that Pelosso might have
encountered someone in an Internet chat room who might have meant
danger to her or to the family. The girl was not adept at using the
computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Pelosso, Silvina's mother, has flown in from the central
Argentine city of Cordoba, where her family has a bottling plant
and a cattle ranch. She was distraught and mystified when
interviewed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Silvina ``had had absolutely no problems, no threats,'' her
mother said. ``She was happy here _ tranquil, she felt very
protected, even though she couldn't keep the pace. She wrote that
people were always rushing.''
