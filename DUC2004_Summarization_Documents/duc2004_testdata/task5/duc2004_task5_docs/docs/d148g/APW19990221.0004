	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Rescuers were continuing  
an air and ground search for a woman, her daughter and a foreign 
exchange student who disappeared this week during a sightseeing 
visit to Yosemite National Park.

	Carole Sund, 42, of Eureka, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and  
Silvina Pelosso, 16, of Argentina, were reported missing by family 
members on Wednesday, one day after they were scheduled to arrive 
in Stockton after a visit to Yosemite, officials said.

<P>
	No evidence of a car accident, vehicle breakdown or foul play  
has been found, California Highway Patrol Officer Larry Walton said 
Saturday.

	``It's a complete mystery,'' said Deborah Downs, a family friend  
who works with Carole Sund's husband. ``We don't know if they've 
driven off the road. We just don't know what to think. It's every 
parent's nightmare.'' 
</P>

	Downs described Mrs. Sund as a ``pillar of the community'' and  
said it would be out of character for her and the teen-agers not to 
contact family members for days.
