   EUREKA, Calif. _ A grief-stricken but defiant Jens Sund says the
killer of his wife, Carole, his teen-age daughter Julie and a
family friend, Silvina Pelosso, should expect no mercy from his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll personally pull the switch,'' Sund vowed. ``I believe in
capital punishment. And I believe whoever is responsible for this
deserves to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Sund said the discovery of Julie's body last Thursday on a vista
overlooking a reservoir in the foothills _ six days after the
bodies of her mother, 42, and Silvina, 16, were found stuffed in
the trunk of a burned rental car _ allows him and his three other
children to seek closure to a family tragedy that began to unfold
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fate of the missing trio from Eureka is now known,
six weeks after they mysteriously disappeared on Feb. 15 while on a
trek to Yosemite National Park, many questions remain unanswered.
Still unknown is when and where they were abducted, when they were
separated and who killed them.
</P>
<P>
   For Jens Sund and his surviving children, it has been a tortuous
time. ``It's very difficult. Sometimes it's almost unbearable, but
we have to go on,'' he said on Sunday in an interview that broke
his public silence.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no plans to visit the sites where the bodies were
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will mourn them here. This is our home,'' Sund said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund sat at his kitchen table and talked quietly about his
family's loss and his determination to continue his wife's work
with abused children. Sund said he finds it incomprehensible that
Carole, a woman who tried to help troubled children avoid a life of
crime, was herself a murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI called to tell him that her body had been found in
the trunk of the rental car, Sund said it was devastating. ``Even
though I had had weeks to expect the worse, it hit me very hard,''
he said. He bundled up his children and retreated to a cabin at a
ranch along the Mad River owned by Carole's parents, Carole and
Francis Carrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telephone or television. We heat with a wood stove.
It's always been a very special place for all of us,'' Sund said.
``There's cooking to do. Household chores to be done. I go to my
office now and then. But sometimes I feel like I'm just going
through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they married, Carole and Jens Sund moved to Eureka
where he joined her father's development business. Carole, while
maintaining her own real-estate loan business, for the past 15
years was the family organizer, he said. She became involved in
local schools and in programs to help troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Julie, 15, was the eldest sister to three adopted siblings.
``That girl loved life from the very beginning,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juliana's Giant Scrapbook'' brims with photos of family
outings, a letter from the grammar school and ticket stubs to the
film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie was going to get somewhere,'' he said. ``She wanted to
be an architect. She was a very determined young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, Sund pointed to the old oak piano that Julie
played regularly. ``It is the silence now that can be the most
difficult,'' Sund said.
</P>
<P>
   By appearing on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's
``Today'' show on Monday, Sund said he hoped to further the youth
programs his wife worked for. ``People keep asking us what they can
do. I know Carole would want to help the children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Easter approached, Sund said he prepared for sharply
conflicting emotions. Carole Sund had already bought Easter
presents for her children and their cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a happy time. But I don't look forward to
Easter without Carole and Julie,'' he said. Sund said he most
misses his wife's companionship. ``There are times when I want to
call her and ask her how she thinks this is all going. I know she'd
have it better organized.''
