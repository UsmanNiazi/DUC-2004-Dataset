   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A hotel handyman who reportedly told the
authorities that he killed a Yosemite naturalist and three tourists
said in an interview with a San Francisco television station that
he had dreamed about killing women for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am guilty,'' Cary Stayner, 37, told television station KBWB.
He said he killed three tourists _ Carole Sund, her daughter Juli
Sund and family friend Silvina Pelosso _ and naturalist Joie
Armstrong. ``None of the women were sexually abused in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was aired Monday night, just hours after FBI
investigators said that Stayner, a resident handyman at the Cedar
Lodge just outside the Yosemite National Park, had confessed to
killing Armstrong, and law enforcement sources confirmed that he
had also admitted to the slayings of the Sunds and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview, Stayner described killing Sund, her
daughter and Pelosso, a family friend from Argentina, in
mid-February and then how he killed Armstrong on July 21 near her
cabin just inside the Yosemite park.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, who did not appear on camera, told the television
station that he strangled Pelosso and Carole Sund in their rented
cabin at the Cedar Lodge, then took Juli Sund to a lake, where he
killed her early the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said he abandoned their rental car with the bodies of Pelosso
and Carole Sund in it, returning two days later to burn evidence
and retrieve Carole Sund's wallet, which he dumped in Modesto to
confuse the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner told KBWB that he was the person who tipped the FBI to
the whereabouts of Juli Sund's body by sending an anonymous letter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he had gotten away with the crimes and did
not leave the area for fear of drawing attention to himself. That
changed when he met Armstrong last week and struck up a chance
conversation with her. He said he could not resist the urge to kill
her when he realized she was alone.
</P>
<P>
   To the victims' families, Stayner told KBWB, ``I am sorry their
loved ones were where they were when they were. I wish I could have
controlled myself and not done what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Nick Rossi would not say whether Stayner's statements
to the television station were consistent with what he has told
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A court affidavit released Monday, signed by FBI agent Michael
Repucci, said Stayner admitted to investigators that he had killed
Armstrong, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stayner provided details about the crime that are not
generally known outside law enforcement, and which corroborate his
confession,'' the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   That confession came at the same time the FBI said it had
discovered evidence linking Stayner to the killings of the Sunds
and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have developed specific information linking Stayner to the
Sund-Pelosso murders,'' James Maddock, head of the FBI's Sacramento
bureau, said Sunday. ``We believe that we have the responsible
party for all of these murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources said Stayner had confessed committing
all four slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, Juli Sund, 15, and Pelosso, 16, were last seen
on Feb. 15 at dinner at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, just outside
Yosemite's southwestern entrance, where Stayner had worked and
lived for nearly two years. Carole Sund and Pelosso's remains were
found March 19 and Juli Sund's body was found March 25.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in the killings of Sund and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was interviewed by agents in Sacramento after his arrest
at a nudist colony on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reportedly also found incriminating evidence in
Stayner's apartment near the Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Stayner made his first court appearance in federal
court in Sacramento and was charged with killing Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Looking clean-cut and tan with a taut build, Stayner nodded as
U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Nowinski read the charge against him in
connection with the Armstrong killing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowinski set the next hearing for Aug. 6 in federal court in
Fresno. At that time Stayner will likely enter a plea.
