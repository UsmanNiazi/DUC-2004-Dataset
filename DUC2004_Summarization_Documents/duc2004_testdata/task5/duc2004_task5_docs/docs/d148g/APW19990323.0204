	SIERRA VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- One of the last photographs of  
Carole Sund shows her laughing during a trip to Yosemite National 
Park with her daughter and a close family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an image her grieving family is thankful to have.  
</P>
<P>
	The photograph was released Monday as authorities identified  
Mrs. Sund's remains, found last week in the charred hulk of the 
rental car the three women were using when they vanished during 
last month's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another body found in the trunk of the car has not been  
identified. Mrs. Sund, 42, was traveling with her daughter Julie, 
15, and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a friend from Argentina, when they 
vanished Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI used dental records to identify Mrs. Sund's body and may  
use DNA tests to identify the other victim. Agents said an autopsy 
had been performed but did not disclose Mrs. Sund's cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said agents are pursuing leads to find the third person,  
but refused to elaborate and also did not say where the film was 
found. Only seven photographs were released at the family's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the photographs) mean a lot, because they're the last  
ones we'll ever have. We're very grateful for them,'' said Carole 
Carrington, Mrs. Sund's mother. ``They also mean that they were 
having a wonderful time and we're glad about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The photos of the women, believed to have been taken Feb. 14 or  
15, show them in joyful poses -- Julie and Silvina smiling in front 
of a Yosemite waterfall, Mrs. Sund and Silvina laughing near the 
Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance five weeks ago prompted a massive search in  
mining country just outside Yosemite. The FBI found the burned out 
car Friday in a forest, about three hours north of the Cedar Lodge 
in El Portal, the spot near Yosemite where the women had been 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was moved over the weekend to a hangar at nearby  
Columbia Airport, where arson experts from the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms looked for tell-tale chemical residues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arson is often used to cover up or conceal evidence of other  
crimes such as murder. However, there is potential to obtain 
incriminating evidence even after a fire,'' said B.J. Zapor, a 
spokesman for the ATF. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis and Carole Carrington spoke briefly after their daughter  
was identified, dry-eyed but clearly stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst nightmare that could ever happen,''  
Carrington said. ``Why people would do this to three good people -- 
I just can't imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund's husband and Julie's father, Jens Sund, was in  
seclusion at the family home in Eureka with the couple's three 
other children. 
</P>
<P>
	On CNN's ``Larry King Live'' on Monday night, Silvina's mother,  
Raquel Pelosso, said she feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there's no chance they can find my daughter alive,''  
she said.
