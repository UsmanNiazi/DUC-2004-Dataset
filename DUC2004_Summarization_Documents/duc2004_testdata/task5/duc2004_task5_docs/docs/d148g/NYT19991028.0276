   SAN FRANCISCO _ The families of three slain Yosemite sightseers
have filed wrongful death suits against Cary Stayner, the motel
handyman accused of killing them, and against the lodge where he
worked and allegedly attacked the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The suits were filed Wednesday in Fresno County Superior Court
on behalf of the families of Carole and Juli Sund and Silvina
Pelosso, who disappeared Feb. 15 from the Cedar Lodge near
Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both families say the lawsuits have several goals,
including obtaining information about the killings, holding Stayner
and the motel responsible, and preventing Stayner from later
profiting from his story.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunds' attorney, Zachary Zwerdling, said it is still unclear
what occurred the night of the killings, how much the motel knew
about Stayner and what security measures they took to protect
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have questions about what happened and this is the only way
to get answers about it,'' said Zwerdling.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rankin, spokesman for Cedar Lodge, said he had not
received the suit yet and was only able to release a short prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief that the person responsible for the tragedy
that has befallen the Sund and Pelosso families is Cary Stayner,
who according to news reports has confessed to the crimes and who
now stands formally charged with the crimes in state court,'' read
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 38, was charged with murder last week in Mariposa
County for the deaths of 42-year-old Carole Sund, her 15-year-old
daughter Juli, and Pelosso, 16, a family friend. He was indicted in
August in the beheading of naturalist Joie Armstrong, 26, who
disappeared in July. If convicted in either homicide case, he could
receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's attorney, federal public defender Robert Rainwater,
said he didn't believe Stayner has been served with the suit yet
and is unaware if Stayner has retained a civil attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine it's the least of his worries,'' said
Rainwater of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   While Stayner, who remains in Fresno County Jail, has confessed
to the killings in various interviews, some of the information _
including whether he sexually assaulted the women _ has been
contradicted by court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund, Carole's husband, said such conflicting reports have
made him anxious to know what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really believe him, because he keeps changing his
story,'' said Sund, of Eureka, Calif. ``I'd like to know but then
part of me doesn't want to know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Sund would like to know what supervision was
placed on Stayner and what, if any, screening was done when Stayner
was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner reportedly worked on and off for the lodge and was laid
off at the time of the Sund and Pelosso killings. Steven Fabbro,
attorney for the Pelosso family, said he's found complaints from
other guests about Stayner that should have raised concerns from
officials at the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew or should have known that he was harassing guests
and he presented a danger to them,'' said Fabbro.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbro said Stayner was apparently able to roam the motel and
may have had access to a master key, with which he could have
gotten into the Sunds' and Pelosso's room. He said it is
questionable if Carole Sund, a normally cautious woman, would have
let Stayner into the room, as he has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that the women were given a remote room
that may have made them easier targets for Stayner.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Sund said he would like to see motels increase their
security to help prevent future incidents like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunds' lawsuit does not specify a damage amount. The Pelosso
suit asks for $10 million in general damages and $10 million in
punitive damages.
