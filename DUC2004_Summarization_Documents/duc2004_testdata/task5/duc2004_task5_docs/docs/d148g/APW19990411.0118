	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- An overflow crowd of more than 1,000  
people attended a memorial service Sunday for Carole Sund and her 
15-year-old daughter Julie, whose deaths on a trip to Yosemite 
National Park remain unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners at Sacred Heart Church remembered the mother and  
daughter in pictures, poems, prayers and songs. 
</P>
<P>
	On the altar, Julie's violin lay propped on her purple and  
silver cheerleading pom-poms. On a table beside it were tulips and 
irises from her mother's garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where we move on,'' Jens Sund, her husband, said  
before the service. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother and daughter and 16-year-old Argentine exchange  
student Silvina Pelosso were last seen alive Feb. 15, starting a 
massive search. Last month, Mrs. Sund's and Silvina's bodies were 
found in the trunk of their burned rental car. Julie's body was 
found a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Thomas Keys urged mourners to remember positive things  
about Julie and Mrs. Sund as they struggled to understand their 
violent deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anger, hate and fear are powerful emotions. But so are hope,  
love and faith,'' Keys said. ``We have to remember that out of 
darkness comes light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, was remembered as a devoted mother, competent  
businesswoman and tireless volunteer for neglected children. Julie 
was remembered as an accomplished musician and a fiercely loyal 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last people to speak was 13-year-old Gina Sund, who  
wrote a poem about her mother and sister and asked people not to 
despair when they see her around town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of my mother laughing in a chair, and her smile and  
happiness,'' she said as the crowd wept.
