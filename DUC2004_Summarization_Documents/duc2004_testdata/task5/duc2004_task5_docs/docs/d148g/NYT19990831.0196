   SAN FRANCISCO _ A motel handyman directed the FBI to the
bloodstained knives he said he used to behead a Yosemite National
Park naturalist last month and to slash the throat of a teen-age
tourist in February, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, 38, also admitted to sexually assaulting the
teen-ager, Juli Sund, and her friend Silvina Pelosso before killing
them, the records said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, filed in federal court in Fresno on Monday, are
the most detailed account yet of Stayner's reported confession to
FBI agents to the killings of Armstrong in July and Sund, her
mother, Carole, and their friend during a sightseeing tour of
Yosemite National Park in February.
</P>
<P>
   The knives Stayner said he used to decapitate Armstrong and
slash Juli Sund's throat appeared to have dried blood on them, and
investigators expected to lift fingerprints and other trace
evidence from them, the FBI said in the six-page affidavit seeking
samples of Stayner's hair, blood and saliva.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Stayner, Robert Rainwater, fought the
request to give the samples to the FBI, but U.S. Magistrate
Lawrence O'Neill signed a warrant Monday ordering Stayner to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner has been charged only in the Armstrong slaying. Although
he reportedly confessed to FBI investigators, he has pleaded not
guilty to the killing. Investigators say Stayner is the prime
suspect in the killings of the Sunds and Pelosso and sources have
said that he will probably be charged with those crimes before his
next scheduled court appearance on Dec. 2 in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 26, was killed July 21 near her home in Foresta,
Mariposa County.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, Juli Sund, 15, and Pelosso, 16, a family friend
from Argentina, disappeared on Feb. 15 after checking into the
Cedar Lodge outside of the Yosemite National Park. Stayner had
lived and worked as a handyman at the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The charred remains of Carole Sund and Pelosso were found March
19 in the trunk of their burned rental car. Juli Sund's body was
found a week later near Don Pedro Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview with a television reporter shortly
after his arrest on July 24, Stayner admitted to the killings but
denied sexually assaulting any of his alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the affidavit, Stayner told investigators that
on Feb. 15, he ``sexually assaulted Juli Sund and Silvina Pelosso
and murdered both Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso.'' He admitted to
entering the room of the three tourists at the Cedar Lodge and
binding them with duct tape. He left the room with Juli Sund and
killed her later, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Stayner became a suspect in the
Armstrong case after a Yosemite employee reported seeing a white
and blue International Scout, identical to the one owned by
Stayner, parked near Armstrong's home on the night the naturalist
was killed. A second park employee told the FBI he picked up a
hitchhiker near a similar International Scout later that same
night.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, investigators compared tire tracks found at the
Armstrong crime scene with the tire tread on Stayner's Scout and
found a possible match. The next day, Stayner did not show up for
work. Nor could he be found in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the FBI found Stayner at the Laguna del Sol
Nudist Park in the Sacramento County town of Wilton after receiving
a tip from a woman who met him at the bar there the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not have an arrest warrant for Stayner, only a
warrant to search his vehicle. But Stayner voluntarily agreed to
accompany agents back to the FBI office in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   There, after waiving his right to remain silent and speak to a
lawyer, Stayner not only described the Armstrong slaying in detail
but also stunned investigators by admitting to the Sund-Pelosso
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, investigators were focusing on a loose-knit group of
methamphetamine users in Modesto. In June, James Maddock, the head
of the FBI's Sacramento office, had said the people responsible for
the Sund-Pelosso killings were already in jail for other crimes.
Stayner had been questioned in February, but was discounted as a
suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said that Stayner gave details to interrogators
that only the killer would know.
