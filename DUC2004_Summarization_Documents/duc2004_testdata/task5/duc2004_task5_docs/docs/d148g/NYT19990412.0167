   EUREKA, Calif. _ Inside their modest, pale-green California
bungalow, the routines of family life for Jens Sund and his three
children go on much as they always have.
</P>
<P>
   The family's two dogs, Reggie, a bichon, and Gigi, a poodle,
clamor for attention. Dirty laundry is piled up at the washing
machine. And 10-year-old Jimmy does tricks with a yo-yo in the
kitchen and begs his dad to let him go to a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not tonight,'' said Jens Sund, warming his hands with a cup of
tea. ``You had a friend over for the last 24 hours. Me and you are
going to hang out one-on-one. We're going to go out and buy you
some shin guards and black soccer socks.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying gear for Jimmy's upcoming indoor soccer season is part of
Jens Sund's effort to preserve some sense of normalcy for his
family, despite the mid- February slayings of his wife, Carole,
15-year-old daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16,
after their visit to Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Walking past a hallway lined with framed family photos assembled
by his wife, Jens Sund opened the door to Juli's room, which has
been left mostly untouched since her death. On her bed were two
Eureka High School yearbooks and a recent issue of Cheerleader
magazine. Posters of her favorite recent movies, ``A Bug's Life''
and ``Titanic,'' hung on the walls next to photos she has taken at
her grandparents' ranch. A snowboard she'd barely touched leaned
against the dresser.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said he is trying to use the room to keep it from becoming
a shrine. He and other family members often take naps on her bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as morbid or weird as you think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the family gathers to pay respects to Carole and
Juli Sund. On Saturday afternoon, under a steady rain, the family
held a private memorial service at St. Bernard's Catholic cemetery.
Of the three bodies, only Juli's remains have been released by the
FBI, so the family has put off a formal burial until a later date.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,000 people, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, are
expected at a public memorial service Sunday at 2 p.m. at Sacred
Heart Church in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   The return to day-to-day life has been a struggle, friends said.
Those close to the family describe Carole Sund as a kind of
Supermom who held the family together with her nonstop energy.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund has tried to fill the void for his three remaining
children while he copes with the gruesome nature of Carole and
Juli's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund allowed The Examiner into his home last week as he and
his family prepared for the weekend services. Sund hopes media
attention about the case will help the FBI and other law
enforcement officials find the killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation inches forward, Sund is trying to move
beyond details of the crime to focus on his children, Jonah, 14,
Gina, 13, and Jimmy. All three were adopted by the Sunds as babies.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, he fixes his youngest son a breakfast of bacon and
eggs, while scanning the morning headlines for news in the case. He
has taken time off work as a vice president at his in-laws' real
estate firm to pick the kids up from school, attend their
basketball games and take them shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids need me,'' said Sund, standing in the dining room
before a table covered with pictures of Carole and the children,
which will be used for the Sunday service. ``And I think if I can
help the kids, they can help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the children is working with a counselor. Jens Sund also
wants his kids to keep focused on their regular activities.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he let his two older children go on an American
history trip last week with their seventh- and eighth-grade
classmates to Washington, D.C., that got them back late Friday,
just before the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carole had planned the trip and paid for it,'' said Carole
Carrington, Carole Sund's mother. ``It was a hard decision. When
something like this happens, it can frighten you and you don't want
your kids to go away across the country. He decided they should go
away on the trip and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of stress have taken a toll on Jens Sund. He sleeps
just a few hours a night, which is visible in the dark crescents
under his eyes. He rarely sleeps past 4 a.m. and tries to make the
best of it by going jogging at sunrise on the beach with his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has given up the few drinks he used to have weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says he has become obsessed with his workout
machine, the Health Rider. He has lost 13 pounds since his wife and
daughter disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his family have gotten a boost from the cards,
poems and teddy bears sent by people from around the country, and
from the kind words of strangers who recognize him from TV. He said
he will continue to do some interviews, including an appearance on
Oprah Winfrey's show to discuss child abuse, but does not want to
become a spokesman for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do this for the rest of my life,'' he said.
``I'm going back to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends are amazed that Sund has stayed so focused and steady
throughout the ordeal and through countless interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows my mind,'' said David Oehler, a family friend. ``I
can't imagine I'd be handling this anywhere near as well as he has.
He's so methodical. He just takes on one thing right after another.
He's been like that throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been three weeks since the family heard that the red 1999
Pontiac Grand Prix Carole Sund had rented for the trip to Yosemite
had been found charred in remote woods off Highway 108 near Long
Barn, Tuolumne County. DNA tests revealed that the two bodies in
the trunk were Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso, an exchange student
living with the family.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Sund's body was found the following week 30 miles away near
Moccasin, Tuolumne County.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI believes the trio was either kidnapped or carjacked in
the El Portal area on the night of Feb. 15 or the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made, but FBI agents and Tuolumne County
sheriff's deputies have been scouring the area, focusing on
residents with criminal records.
