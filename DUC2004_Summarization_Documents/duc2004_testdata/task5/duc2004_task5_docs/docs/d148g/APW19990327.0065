	SONORA, Calif. (AP) -- They thought they were prepared for the  
worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when the families of three missing tourists learned that one  
of the women's bodies was discovered near Yosemite National Park, 
news was no less painful to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on Friday said the body found near a reservoir west  
of Yosemite was that of 15-year-old Julie Sund, and that the second 
body found last week in the trunk of their torched rental car 
likely was her friend, Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were prepared to hear this news, but we were not ready when  
we heard it. My feelings at this time are as any mother's,'' said 
Raquel Pelosso, Silvania's mother, on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie, her mother Carole Sund, 42, and Silvina, a 16-year-old  
exchange student from Cordoba, Argentina, all disappeared six weeks 
ago while on a sightseeing trip. Mrs. Sund's body was identified 
Monday as one of two corpses were found in the trunk of their 
torched rental car in remote Sierra Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will bring all available resources to bear to solve this  
horrible crime,'' said FBI agent James Maddock. ``We are all 
committed to solving this crime and bringing those responsible to 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on how Julie or the other sightseers died  
or what led investigators to her body. 
</P>
<P>
	After Julie's body was identified, family members recounted  
jovial stories about the young woman, a violinist and cheerleading 
squad member who was preparing to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just a really sweet girl and typical teen-ager. I'm  
going to miss her so much,'' said Carole Carrington, Julie's 
grandmother, choking back tears at a press conference at her 
Modesto hotel. Flags there were flying at half mast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, Julie and Silvina were last seen alive Feb. 15 just  
outside Yosemite, eating hamburgers at the Cedar Lodge restaurant 
in El Portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie's body was found on a steep, grassy hill that drops into  
Don Pedro Lake reservoir, about an hour from where their torched 
car was found. It also is on one of the most direct routes to 
Modesto, where Mrs. Sund's billfold was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said investigators still have not been able to move the  
timeline past when the women were last seen at the Cedar Lodge 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental records were used to identify Mrs. Sund and her daughter.
