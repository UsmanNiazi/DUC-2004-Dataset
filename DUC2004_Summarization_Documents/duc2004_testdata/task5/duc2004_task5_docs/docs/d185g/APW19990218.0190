<HEADLINE> Rev. Lyons Won't Testify at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- After the Rev. Henry Lyons declined to  
testify in his racketeering trial, his co-defendant and alleged 
mistress told jurors she didn't advise Lyons of her own criminal 
conviction when she began working for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice Edwards and Lyons, president of the National Baptist  
Convention USA, are accused of swindling more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to do business with the influential black 
church organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Lyons and Ms. Edwards duped companies into  
believing the convention had 8.5 million members and a membership 
list that would allow the companies to target marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Without telling jurors she was convicted in 1993 of  
embezzlement, Ms. Edwards said Thursday that she was put on 
probation for three years shortly before meeting Lyons at a church 
function. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't something that I was proud of,'' she said. ``I had  
made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards said she did not tell Lyons about the conviction  
when she began working to help his election as president, but did 
inform him of it before being hired as the convention's public 
relations director. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, who has been described as Lyons' girlfriend, denied  
there was any romantic involvement when he offered her the public 
relations job in 1994. Prosecutors say the two used the money to 
buy an expensive waterfront home, luxury cars and diamond jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Lyons said his decision not to testify was made  
partly because he faces a federal trial in April on charges of 
fraud, extortion and money laundering.
