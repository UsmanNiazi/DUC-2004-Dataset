 &HT;    Defense takes helm in Baptist leader's trial
 &HT;    By Mike Williams

<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ After two weeks of testimony about luxury shopping
sprees, hidden love affairs and secret bank accounts, lawyers for
the Rev. Henry Lyons open their defense of the embattled Baptist
leader today.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, 57, and his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, are
charged with swindling more than $4 million from corporations that
hoped to do business with the National Baptist Convention USA, one
of the country's largest African-American denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is president of the group, while Edwards served as its
public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons took the stand briefly Tuesday after the jury was
dismissed for the day, testifying about a convention membership
list he allegedly tried to sell.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys have claimed Lyons made legitimate efforts to
market credit cards, life insurance policies and burial services
for several companies, capitalizing on his leadership role to give
what amounted to a celebrity endorsement for their products.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors put on dozens of witnesses to show that Lyons
used the millions he got from the companies to finance a posh
waterfront home, expensive cars, and a huge diamond and other
luxury gifts for several women who allegedly were his lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons purchased a mink coat and hat for the convention's
director of meetings, Brenda Harris, with whom he was having an
affair, one former convention aide testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day that I came to work for Brenda, she was giving
me an overview of what it was she did,'' Renee Fagans testified.
``Her exact words were: `I'm having an affair with the president
and we're in love.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, a St. Petersburg, Fla. jewelry store owner
testified that Lyons bought Edwards a $36,000 diamond ring. The
5.56-carat ring was ``the size of a dime,'' the jeweler testified,
prompting courtroom spectators to examine their own rings.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the most dramatic testimony, Bonita Henderson,
another former Lyons aide, said Lyons was her lover and that he
paid her $150,000 from a secret account after she quit her job and
ended their affair.
</P>
<P>
   When Lyons was campaigning to become the convention's president
in 1994, Edwards told Henderson a victory would mean ``we were
going to make a lot of money,'' Henderson testified.
</P>
<P>
   After Lyons won, he struck a deal to sell a list of the
convention's members to the Globe Life Insurance Co. of Oklahoma,
which hoped to market policies to the membership, Henderson
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons told the company the membership was 8.5 million, although
the only lists on hand contained about 15,000 names, Henderson
testified. The pair solved the problem by compiling a phony list
using a computer program that contained telephone numbers and
addresses from around the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort back-fired when the company received lots of
complaints from people who received the mailings, including an
imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the quickest and most negative response that I have
ever received in my 27 years of direct marketing,'' Globe vice
president George Burke testified. The company paid Lyons $400,000
for the list, then another $600,000 for a second list that did not
work well either, company executives testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons also took nearly $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League,
saying the money would go to rebuild black churches that were being
burned down across the South in a rash of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Jewish group testified that Lyons claimed six
churches received $35,000 each. In fact, prosecutors produced
evidence showing Lyons gave less than $40,000 to burned churches,
while depositing $60,000 in a personal savings account, spending
part of the money on two alleged love interests, as well as to
redecorate his home and pay off credit card debts.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the key to the case, Pinellas County State
Attorney's investigator David Kurash testified that Lyons routinely
took checks from the corporations made out to the National Baptist
Convention and deposited them in a secret bank account which he
guarded carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money belongs to the corporation, in this case, the
National Baptist Convention,'' Kurash told jurors. ``The president
of the organization has no more right to dig in and take possession
of the funds for his own personal use than the janitor does.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' alleged misdeeds came to light in 1997 when his wife set
fire to a $700,000 waterfront home Lyons had purchased with
Edwards. Deborah Lyons told police she suspected her husband was
having an affair, but later changed her story and has since stood
by him.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons faces up to 30 years in prison, and also must stand trial
on federal charges later this spring. His attorneys would not say
whether he will testify before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be decided toward the end of the defense's case,''
attorney Denis de Vlaming said.
