   MIAMI _ The Rev. Henry Lyons, the nationally prominent black
minister from Florida who was convicted this month on charges of
racketeering and grand theft, stepped down Tuesday as president of
the National Baptist Convention U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, whose lavish lifestyle of Rolls-Royces, expensive
real estate and other excesses was bankrolled by large corporations
trying to buy his influence in black communities, had survived
attempts to oust him as president of the nation's largest black
religious organization. He even won a vote of confidence from the
convention's leaders after his indictment on state and federal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, two weeks after his conviction in a Pinellas
County Circuit Court, and with his lawyers reportedly working on a
plea agreement just weeks before a federal trial on similar
charges, the St. Petersburg minister finally resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``With tremendous dignity,'' his attorney, Grady Irvin, told
reporters outside Lyons' home church, Bethel Metropolitan Baptist
Church in St. Petersburg, in describing Lyons' announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very remorseful,'' Irvin said, ``with respect to any
difficulty he has caused the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons faces a maximum 8 1/2 years in prison when he is sentenced
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. S.C. Cureton of Greenville, S.C., will be the interim
president, until Lyons' term expires in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons continued to enjoy the support of his own parishioners and
prominent religious leaders as his troubles piled higher. He sold
bogus and highly inflated convention membership lists to
corporations who wanted to sell life and burial insurance and
market other things in black communities, ultimately leading to his
conviction on racketeering charges. He stole $4 million in all,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his other crime, pocketing some $240,000 in donations
to black churches burned by arson, that led to his grand theft
conviction and more greatly embarrassed convention members.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons did more than embarrass them, said some black ministers.
He betrayed people who believe in the black church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary on the religious community and for
Baptists, and it has a far-reaching effect,'' said the Rev.
Franklin R. Clark, pastor at Mount Olivette Baptist Church in
Miami's Overtown section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been exploited,'' he said. ``It leaves a bitter taste in
my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons waited too long to step down, said the Rev. Calvin O.
Butts III, pastor at the Abyssinian Church in New York, whose name
is often mentioned as a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long overdue,'' said Butts.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's board of directors should have seen the need
for Lyons' resignation two years ago, when his legal troubles began
to take shape, said Butts.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, black ministers said they hope it is the
beginning of a more accountable leadership in the convention, which
has allowed its presidents almost a free hand in running its
business. Lyons, by his own lawyers' admission, ran the
organization from a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to go on,'' said the Rev. Herman Powell, the
pastor of Early Grove Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But some, like Butts, see a need for a complete overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great desire would be for the convention to elect a
governing board for a year to re-structure the organization, get
new board members, audit the books, etc.,'' he said. ``Otherwise, I
don't think these changes will happen. Eventually, there would be a
return to the old ways.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not a candidate for president this fall, but in
the future, ``Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want anyone to believe I was being outspoken simply
as a desire to become president,'' Butts said.
</P>
<P>
   Convention presidents serve for five years, and can be
re-elected once.
</P>
<P>
   At Lyons' church in St. Petersburg, parishioners still stood
behind him on Tuesday. Some on the church's deacon board even asked
for a show of hands in support of him, but Lyons ``would not allow
them to take that vote,'' said his lawyer, Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the people did not want him to resign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His defense team had described his actions as failed business
dealings, not crimes, and said that prosecutors did not understand
the authority that a black community invested in its minister.
</P>
<P>
   But many, like Clark in Miami, said he failed the people who
trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worship God,'' he said, ``because man fails.''
