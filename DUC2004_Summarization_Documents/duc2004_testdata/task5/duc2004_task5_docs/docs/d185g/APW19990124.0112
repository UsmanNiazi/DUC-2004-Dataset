<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Gets Day in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- First he said he did nothing wrong. Then he  
admitted mistakes and asked for mercy. Now he's on trial, accused 
of crimes several steps removed from the rumors of an extramarital 
affair that first jeopardized his job and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry Lyons says the biggest difference between himself  
-- the prominent leader of a large black church organization, the 
National Baptist Convention USA -- and President Clinton is that 
ordinary Americans already have forgiven Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of amazing to see especially African-Americans bless  
him so much and so willing to stone me,'' Lyons told a Nashville, 
Tenn., television station last week. ``But I hope to overcome even 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were scheduled to begin in Florida on Monday  
in Lyons' racketeering and grand theft trial. If convicted, he 
could be sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The case started in the summer of 1997 when Lyons' wife was  
charged with setting fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he owned 
with another woman. The news prompted prosecutors to follow the 
trail of the minister's money, and they found records of expensive 
homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors pointed to a secret bank account and accused him of  
stealing the money used to finance his lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-owner of the waterfront house was Lyons' co-defendant in  
the trial, Bernice Edwards, the convention's former public 
relations director. She is charged with racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of duping companies seeking to do business  
with the convention's members. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand theft charge against Lyons involves more than $200,000  
entrusted to him by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to 
help rebuild Southern black churches burned by arson fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony is expected to last about a month and revolve around  
financial details of deals between Lyons and white businessmen 
hoping to secure a segment of the black consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
	After his state trial, Lyons is scheduled to stand trial this  
spring on 54 federal charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases center in large part on Lyons' and Edwards' dealings  
with the world's second-largest funeral company, The Loewen Group, 
based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wanted to crack the black community, where people  
traditionally seek out independent black funeral directors. Lyons' 
claims that the convention had more than 8.5 million black members 
was a hoax, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was to deliver black Baptists and the convention would  
receive 33 percent of sales through commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, prosecutors say, just $187,600 of Loewen's money went  
to market cemetery plots, while more than $1.6 million went to 
Lyons, his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the fire that started the investigation, Lyons' wife,  
Deborah, denied ever believing her husband had cheated on her, 
blaming her actions on problems with alcohol. She was sentenced to 
five years' probation on an arson charge. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Lyons denied the accusations for months before  
publicly apologizing for unnamed transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sinned,'' he said. ``And I have displayed human  
weaknesses and frailties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons has survived several attempts to oust him as president of  
the National Baptist Convention USA, although three ministers now 
are challenging his attempt to win another five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want America, African-Americans and all Americans to know  
that Henry Lyons is not guilty of all these crimes,'' Lyons said 
last week, ``and I just need my day in court.''
