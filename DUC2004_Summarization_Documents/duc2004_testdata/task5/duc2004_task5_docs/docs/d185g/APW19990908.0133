	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Many candidates to succeed the Rev. Henry  
Lyons as president of the National Baptist Convention USA believe 
the powers of his office contributed to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The election today of his successor could signal how far one of  
the nation's largest black church groups will go to prevent the 
kind of abuses that put Lyons in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 delegates and visitors to the group's annual  
meeting were expected to gather for the election of the replacement 
for Lyons, the St. Petersburg minister currently serving 5 1/2 years 
for racketeering and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who also pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion and fraud  
charges, resigned after swindling $4 million from businesses and 
failing to distribute nearly $250,000 contributed by the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith to help rebuild burned black 
churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which traces its roots to 1880, claims 8.5  
million members, though at Lyons' trial prosecutors said the figure 
was inflated. They said membership is around 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the scandal, many of the 11 candidates say the  
president's powers should be reduced. A good number of the 
convention's board of directors are appointed by the president 
rather than being elected. And the president also has control of 
the group's checkbook, giving the executive broad control over the 
group's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	During a candidates' forum Tuesday, the Rev. W. Franklyn  
Richardson, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., described the presidency as an 
``imperialist institution'' and advocated dismantling a ``rubber 
stamp wimp board'' by having board members elected to fixed terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, along with candidates the Rev. Jasper Williams of  
Atlanta and the Rev. William Shaw of Philadelphia, was among a 
group of ministers who unsuccessfully sought to have Lyons ousted 
in 1997 as he came under state and federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those candidates blamed the group's political structure for  
helping lead to Lyons' downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason Henry J. Lyons is not on stage with us today but in  
a bunk in a jail cell is the system,'' Williams said. ``This system 
will corrupt any man no matter how good his intentions are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Lyons' tenure, attendance at the convention-operated  
American Baptist College in Nashville, Tenn., declined, and loans 
to settle lawsuits are coming due. Still, Lyons helped reduce the 
group's debt on its Nashville headquarters from $6 million to less 
than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edward V. Hill, a Los Angeles minister who supported  
Lyons and is running for president, said he always would consider 
him a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe he gave us the energy ... to reach higher  
heights,'' Hill said. ``If you let me, I think I can continue the 
tradition of climbing higher and higher.''
