CHURCH LEADER SAYS HE MADE MISTAKES, SEEKS FORGIVENESS AT
CONVENTION

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rev. Henry J. Lyons on Thursday looked
out solemnly at thousands of church members in Bartle Hall to ask
their indulgence. This was his moment to say he was sorry again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a perfect president,'' said Lyons, head of the
National Baptist Convention USA Inc., the largest black church
organization in the country. ``It took me all my life to come to
this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons found support among the church's delegates in Kansas City,
who earlier in the day passed a resolution urging forgiveness for
personal misconduct by another president _ Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual address to the convention, Lyons said he never
wanted to bring shame and disgrace to the church top office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made some mistakes. I have made some serious
miscalculations of judgment,'' Lyons said, as he has in the past.
``I want you to know truly from the bottom of my heart, from the
bottom of my soul, I am sorry for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you for your mercy. I ask black America and white
America for your mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lyons pulled off his glasses and wiped his eyes with a
handkerchief, thousands of delegates stood with their president,
applauding his apology and shouting, ``Amen!'' to his words.
</P>
<P>
   After asking church members for their understanding, Lyons, who
always gets high marks for preaching, launched into a thunderous
sermon about the healing power of Jesus, bringing at times laughter
and tears from the flock.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his mounting troubles, Lyons survived another year as
National Baptist president. In July he was indicted on federal
theft and fraud charges, accused of bilking corporations out of
millions of dollars and spending convention funds on a lavish
lifestyle. He faces similar state charges filed last February. He
pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, a pastor in St. Petersburg, Fla., admitted on Monday in
Kansas City an ``improper'' relationship with Brenda Harris, the
organization's executive director of conventions and meetings. The
two-year affair ended in 1997, he said. Lyons and his wife,
Deborah, have been married since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons did not mention Bernice Edwards, the former public
relations director for the convention, with whom he bought a
$700,000 waterfront home in Florida. Harris and Edwards also face
charges of misusing church money.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting last year in Denver, dissident ministers
forced a vote on removing Lyons, but it failed. With one day left
at this year's meeting, no formal call has come for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just before Lyons took the stage Thursday, supporters
organized a fund-raiser for his legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of minutes, with urging from the podium, more than
30 donations of $500 each had been collected. The Rev. E.V. Hill of
Los Angeles read the names of donors as checks were collected,
imploring others to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John D. Chaplin of Washington told members to give
Lyons their ``love offering.'' While the names of $100, $200 and
$500 donors were announced, ushers passed white plastic buckets
down the rows as collection plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know when the devil is at his worst, God is at his best,''
said Chaplin. ``You all know the strategy here. The strategy is to
break us, to bankrupt us, so we can't defend ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Church members, said the Rev. Timothy Fleming of Georgia, must
stick together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could happen to any one of us. It can happen to any
preacher here,'' said Fleming. ``We can't preach the gospel of
forgiveness and practice unforgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in that spirit of forgiveness that the convention
Thursday passed a resolution supporting President Clinton. Because
the president offered a sincere apology for his personal conduct,
the resolution said, he and his family deserved ``loving
forgiveness and prayerful support.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution quoted a Bible passage from Galatians, the same
passage quoted in pro-Lyons fliers circulated at the convention:
``Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, who established close ties to Clinton after Lyons was
elected church president in 1994, used his address to defend
Clinton and criticize independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation and Republican detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to let America know, we want the world to know, we
stand firmly behind our president. We'd like to see the majority
Republican Congress get off his back,'' Lyons said. ``We accepted
his words. We thank God he and Mrs. Clinton are faring well, and we
are praying for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In another resolution, members approved a rule that churches
that failed to register at this year's meeting and pay their dues
would not be allowed to vote in the 1999 election for president.
The rule, in effect, means that ministers who withheld funds
because of their concerns about Lyons' financial management can't
vote for the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said that for now he planned to run for re-election next
year. At least five others have announced their candidacies,
including Lyons' longstanding critics, the Rev. William Shaw of
Philadelphia and the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson of Mount Vernon,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lyons told members the financial footing of the
convention was sound, he also said the church needed $664,000 by
Oct. 15 on a loan that is coming due. He implored members to help
meet that deadline, even if they were still unhappy with him as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say, `I'm still mad with him, but I'm going to give the
money anyway,' '' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, $300,000 more will be due, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the game plan,'' Lyons said. ``I have always told you
exactly where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Lyons thanked members for contributions to his
legal defense fund. He recounted in his sermon the New Testament
story about a sickly woman who worked her way through a crowd just
to touch Jesus' garment in hopes of being healed. At the same time,
a rich man was trying to get Jesus to come to his home to heal his
dying daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons likened the rich man to the main course at a restaurant,
the woman to a lowly side dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the main course,'' he told church members, who raised
their arms in praise and spilled out into the aisles at Bartle
Hall, ``and I'm the side order.''
