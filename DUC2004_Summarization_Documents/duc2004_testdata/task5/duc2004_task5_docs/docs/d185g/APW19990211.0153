<HEADLINE> Ministers: Lyons Didn't Abuse Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons put a huge down payment  
on a $700,000 home, bought a 5.5-carat diamond ring and spent 
lavishly on cars, furniture and clothing, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	But his peers testified Wednesday that he did not abuse church  
funds as president of the National Baptist Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot think of anything he did under this administration  
that the previous presidents did not have the privilege to do,'' 
the Rev. Lacy Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was one of three convention ministers who testified as the  
defense began presenting evidence at Lyons' racketeering trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, are accused of  
swindling more than $4 million from companies hoping to sell 
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards to 
convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention voted to keep Lyons as president after Florida  
prosecutors began investigating his finances in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A convention ethics commission reviewed Lyons' conduct, focusing  
only on whether he stole any money from its treasuries, and found 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we zeroed in on and that's what we dealt with,  
mainly,'' said the Rev. Edward V. Hill, who led the commission. 
``We didn't want to go any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say failed business deals are not criminal  
matters. They spent much of Wednesday presenting testimony from the 
ministers who said they believe Lyons has the right to earn profit 
from his post as president and to spend the money as he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. H.L. Harvey agreed. He testified the convention claimed  
more than 8 million members years before Lyons became president. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said an 8.5 million membership figure was a  
hoax -- and Lyons and Ms. Edwards used it to court companies seeking 
access to the group's members, promising them use of the 
convention's mailing list.
