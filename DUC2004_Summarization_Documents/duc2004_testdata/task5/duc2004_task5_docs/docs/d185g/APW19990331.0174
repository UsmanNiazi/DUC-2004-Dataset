	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- After he was convicted of racketeering and  
grand theft in state court, the Rev. Henry Lyons apologized for his 
crimes and said he was ready to accept his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president of the powerful National Baptist Convention  
USA was to return to court today to receive his sentence, expected 
to be three to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 27, jurors convicted the 57-year-old minister of bilking  
more than $4 million from companies wanting to sell cemetery 
products, life insurance policies and credit cards to convention 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also was convicted of stealing nearly $250,000 from the  
Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, money intended to rebuild 
black churches burned in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 16, Lyons stepped down as head of the convention, one  
of the nation's largest and most influential black denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he avoided a second trial by pleading guilty to  
federal charges of evading taxes, engaging in fraudulent activities 
and lying to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' sentencing in federal court is scheduled for June 18.  
Those charges carry a total possible sentence of 75 years and heavy 
fines.
