 &HT;    Baptist leader called to judgment
 &HT;    By Mike Williams

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He grew up poor but ambitious, loved by a
grandfather who raised him in church, but virtually abandoned by a
fast-living father who never married his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He became a preacher at the tender age of 20, dazzling his
backwoods Georgia congregation with a silky delivery and deft touch
that eventually propelled him to national prominence in one of the
country's largest African-American denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he would attend receptions at the White House, mix
with members of Congress and serve as one of the spiritual leaders
of his people.
</P>
<P>
   But there appear to be two sides to the life of the Rev. Henry
Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper reports, by the time he was 30, Lyons had
stumbled through two divorces and had two children out of wedlock.
Eventually, he adopted a lavish lifestyle that included a
Rolls-Royce, a Mercedes Benz and a $700,000 waterfront home
purchased with a woman who was not his wife. There are allegations
that he took money intended for rebuilding burned-out black
churches for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' contradictory career goes on display this week in a
Florida courtroom. The president of the National Baptist Convention
USA is charged with stealing millions from businesses affiliated
with the group and spending it on luxury items.
</P>
<P>
   He could be sent to prison for 30 years on the state charges,
which include racketeering and grand theft. This spring, Lyons, 56,
is scheduled to face federal charges of tax evasion, fraud and
money laundering that could bring an 800-year prison term and $25
million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our position that he entered into legitimate business
deals and made his best effort to promote the products'' of the
companies contracting with the convention, said Denis de Vlaming,
one of Lyons' attorneys. ``The businesses got what they paid for,
which amounted to a celebrity endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vlaming said Lyons would not comment prior to his trial.
</P>
<P>
   In several public statements, Lyons has admitted to unspecified
``mistakes and misjudgments,'' but has blasted the charges as
racially motivated. The media, particularly the St. Petersburg
Times newspaper, has singled him out because he is an affluent
black man, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you trying to imply?'' Lyons asked reporters at one
news conference. ``That blacks in this country cannot be successful
and live well?''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons has not always lived a high lifestyle. He was born in
Gainesville, Fla., and raised by his grandparents, who took him to
the church where his grandfather, a laborer, was a deacon.
According to an exhaustive St. Petersburg Times profile, Lyons was
a bright child with a winning personality and ambitions to rise
from the limited horizons he found in segregated Gainesville of the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in 1960, he attended all-black
Gibbs Junior College in St. Petersburg. While a student, Lyons
became an assistant pastor at a St. Petersburg church, taking over
for one summer when the pastor took a leave. Lyons went on to
Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Fla., and then to the
Morehouse School of Religion in Atlanta, where he enrolled in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   While still a student, he accepted his first pastorship, serving
at Abysinia Baptist Church in Brunswick, where he commuted from
Atlanta one Sunday a month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he moved to a larger church, Macedonia Baptist in
Thomaston, where he became the full-time minister. His new church
quietly pressured Lyons to marry. He quickly took a bride,
according to the Times, but the marriage ended within a couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons married again within months, this time to a 19-year-old
member of his congregation. Her family objected, and the couple
apparently never lived together. They remained married for several
years, even after Lyons moved away to run Cincinnati Baptist Bible
College and Seminary, a small school in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times report, Lyons had by this time fathered
two children with two different women in Florida, neither of whom
he married. In 1972, Lyons was called to pastor Bethel Metropolitan
Baptist in St. Petersburg. Before he arrived, he married a third
time, taking as his wife a woman he had met in Cincinnati. With his
reassuring touch and powerful oratory, he built the church
membership steadily, starting programs to help the poor and
eventually building a new sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Lyons became an officer in the Florida General Baptist
Convention, an affiliate of the National Baptist Convention USA.
Eventually, he rose to president of the Florida group and
vice-president of the national group. In 1994, Lyons was elected
president of the national convention, making him one of the
country's most prominent African-American religious leaders. That
year he sat on the dais next to President Clinton, who addressed
the group.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit filed by investigators, it was in this
role that Lyons adopted an extravagant lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing deals
</P>
<P>
   After his election, Lyons entered into deals with several
corporations selling credit cards, insurance and funeral services,
telling them his group represented some 8.5 million members. The
group's own records indicate membership is closer to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Nashville, Tenn., bank, Union Planters, lent $300,000
to the convention in a deal in which Lyons was to market credit
cards to convention members. The deal, which later collapsed, was
based on a convention resolution that allegedly bears the forged
signature of the convention's general secretary. In the most
lucrative deal, Lyons agreed to make the Loewen Group, a giant
Canadian funeral services firm, the ``death-care provider of
choice'' for convention members. Over several years, the company
advanced $3.2 million to the convention, most of the money
allegedly winding up in accounts controlled by Lyons and Bernice
Edwards, a convicted embezzler from Milwaukee, Wis., whom Lyons
hired as a public relations specialist for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lyons and Edwards purchased a $700,000 waterfront home
in an exclusive St. Petersburg suburb. Lyons insists the home was
bought as a ``guest house'' for the convention. He adamantly denies
having an affair with Edwards, who faces trial as his co-defendant.
In 1996, Lyons accepted nearly $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation
League, a prominent Jewish group, for distribution to black
churches burned during a rash of alleged hate crimes across the
South. In 1997, Lyons admitted he gave only $30,000 to churches,
with $60,000 going into his personal account. Lyons' attorney later
reimbursed the ADL $214,500.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' ascension to prominence took decades, but his fall came
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, while he was traveling with Edwards and other
convention officials in Nigeria, his wife allegedly ransacked the
waterfront home and set several fires. Deborah Lyons first told
police she suspected her husband was having an affair, but later
said she set the fires by accident. She has stood steadfastly by
him ever since. Despite the charges, Lyons has held onto his
presidency of the National Baptist Convention USA, and has vowed to
run again this year when his term expires. In the mostly-black
south St. Petersburg neighborhood around Bethel Metropolitan,
opinions are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Lyons is a good man who tries to help poor people,''
said Winston Logan, who works at a Caribbean restaurant near the
church. ``He got into a little mishap, but lots of people have done
lots worse. He needs a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Mosley, a jeweler, is appalled. ``I think he's guilty
as hell and he's playing with the name of the Lord,'' Mosley said.
``It's a sad commentary on the Christian ministry.
