   Jerri L. Nielsen, the doctor who developed breast cancer while
trapped at the South Pole by winter weather, diagnosed her illness
and treated herself with the help of a cancer specialist in
Indianapolis who guided her via video-conferencing and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   An account of Dr. Nielsen's treatment while at the South Pole
was published Thursday in The Indianapolis Star. The article was
based on interviews with her specialist, Dr. Kathy Miller, that
began last August.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller and the Indiana University Cancer Center offered the
newspaper the information on the condition that it not be published
until Dr. Nielsen gave her permission. Dr. Miller has refused to be
interviewed by other publications, and Dr. Nielsen has declined any
interviews, citing privacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the published report, Dr. Nielsen, 47, was admitted
to the Indianapolis center on Sunday, a day after being airlifted
out of the South Pole. She remained at the hospital under Dr.
Miller's care until Wednesday. Dr. Nielsen's treatment and
condition were not described in detail. But Dr. Miller said the
tumor, like most breast cancers, appeared to have originated in a
milk duct.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail quoted in the newspaper article, Dr. Miller also
called the cancer ``aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nielsen, the only doctor for a crew of 41 at the
Amundsen-Scott polar research station, first found a lump in her
breast in late May or early June. She had had a normal mammogram a
year earlier, and initially thought the lump was a cyst. But it
grew, and she e-mailed a doctor friend in her home state, Ohio,
asking him to find a cancer specialist to provide long-distance
advice. Dr. Miller was recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller's first advice was that Dr. Nielsen should be flown
out of Antarctica. But that was impossible, because extreme cold
and darkness kept planes from landing. Knowing that in 1961 a
Soviet doctor at the South Pole had removed his own appendix, Dr.
Miller and colleagues then considered the idea of Dr. Nielsen's
operating on herself. But they decided she would not be able to do
an extensive enough operation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation, which runs the research
station, briefly considered having a surgeon parachute in, said Dr.
Karl Erb, director of the foundation's Polar Programs. But he said
last summer that the idea was abandoned for three reasons: the
situation did not seem that urgent, the station was not set up for
surgery, and a surgeon jumping in might be lost in the darkness,
high winds and temperatures colder than 100 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, doctors used video-conferencing to talk Dr. Nielsen
through biopsies, which she performed by inserting a needle into
her breast to draw out cells that could be stained and examined
under a microscope. A video camera was used to transmit images of
the cells to experts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In July, directed by Dr. Miller, with whom she exchanged e-mail
almost every day, Dr. Nielsen began to give herself hormonal
treatment and chemotherapy, which shrank the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But this month the National Science Foundation sent planes to
the South Pole several weeks ahead of its usual schedule, saying
Dr. Nielsen's doctors had urged that she be flown out as soon as
possible. On Saturday an Air National Guard plane was able to
evacuate Dr. Nielsen.
