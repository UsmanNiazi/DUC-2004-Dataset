	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- After a 24-hour delay caused by  
bad weather, two U.S. military cargo planes departed for Antarctica 
Wednesday to prepare to rescue a doctor at the South Pole who has a 
lump in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Air National Guard Hercules LC-130 cargo planes set out for  
McMurdo base on the northern coast of Antarctica after high winds 
and swirling snow eased on the frigid continent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,975-mile flight was expected to take about eight hours,  
putting the planes into McMurdo late Wednesday afternoon New 
Zealand time (1 a.m. Wednesday EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather conditions both at and above McMurdo station are  
favorable, with yesterday's high winds and whiteout conditions 
having cleared away during the night,'' said National Science 
Foundation spokesman Peter West. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in McMurdo, the planes must wait until the temperature at  
the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station rises above minus 58 degrees 
before flying there to pick up Dr. Jerri Nielsen. The temperature 
is expected to rise above that mark within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will decide on a day-by-day basis on whether to undertake  
the pole mercy dash to pick up Dr. Jerri Nielsen,'' West said. The 
decision will depend on the weather conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 47, is the only physician among 41 researchers at the  
Amundsen-Scott base, which is run by the U.S.-based National 
Science Foundation. She discovered a lump in her breast earlier 
this year but could not be evacuated because of the harsh polar 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	It is feared Nielsen has breast cancer, but the NSF has refused  
to discuss her condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement doctor for the station and a team of medics to  
treat Nielsen are on one of the planes, which are fitted with skis 
to allow them to land on the ice at Amundsen-Scott base. 
</P>
<P>
	A daring July flight airdropped medical supplies to Nielsen, and  
she is believed to have been treating herself with chemotherapy 
since then.
