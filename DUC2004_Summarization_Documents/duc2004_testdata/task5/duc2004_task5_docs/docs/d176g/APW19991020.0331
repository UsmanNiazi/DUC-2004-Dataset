<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Has Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nearly five months after she found a lump in  
her breast, a doctor rescued from the South Pole confirmed that she 
has cancer and she will undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, continued to shy away from international  
attention, saying she would not grant any interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diagnosis of breast cancer has been confirmed and I will  
undergo treatment. My spirit is strong,'' Nielsen said Tuesday in 
her first public statement since returning to the United States on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be back with my family and friends in the United  
States,'' she said in the statement issued through the National 
Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, of the Youngstown, Ohio area, treated herself with  
chemotherapy until she was rescued Saturday from the Amundsen-Scott 
South Pole Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The only doctor among the 41 researchers at the station, Nielsen  
discovered a lump in her breast in June. She had medical supplies 
dropped to her a month later during a daring mercy mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and begin  
self-treatment with chemotherapy. She e-mailed photographs of slide 
samples of the tumor to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Nielsen kept busy with her duties up until  
she left the South Pole, said her sister-in-law, Diana Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the rescue operation was possibly the earliest  
ever post-winter flight to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, Nielsen thanked those who rescued her and  
helped with her treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt thanks go out to my South Pole friends,  
colleagues and the general public for their encouragement and best 
wishes during my ordeal,'' she said.
