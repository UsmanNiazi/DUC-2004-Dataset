<HEADLINE> U.S. Doctor Leaves South Pole </HEADLINE>

	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Researchers wearing frosty  
beards and red coats bid a joyful goodbye Saturday to an American 
doctor with a lump in her breast as a plane rescued her from their 
South Pole research station. 
</P>
<P>
	As the special, ski-equipped U.S. military plane taxied slowly  
to avoid creating propeller-driven storms of ice granules before 
taking off, the crew aboard saw ``waves, thumbs up'' from members 
of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were just really pleased we were able to get in and get  
her out,'' said Col. Graham Pritchard, senior commander of the 
rescue team from the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift 
Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, a 47-year-old mother of three, was inspected  
by physicians after the flight from the pole to McMurdo base on 
Antarctica's coast. 
</P>
<P>
	She then flew to Christchurch, in southern New Zealand, where  
she was booked on a flight to Auckland, airport officials said on 
condition of anonymity. Auckland is the country's main 
international gateway. I 
</P>
<P>
	t was believed she would then head home to the United States,  
but military and U.S National Science Foundation officials refused 
to discuss her movements. The 41 researchers at the station were 
from the science foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. Even so, in 
temperatures lower than minus-56, the plane's hydraulic systems -- 
critical to its ability to land and take off -- become hard to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risk factor was eight or nine out of 10,'' said pilot Maj.  
George R. McAllister. ``It was at the limits of the operational 
ability of the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The very thing that brought the warmer weather also reduced  
visibility,'' U.S. Air Force spokesman Capt. Victor Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, discovered a lump in her breast  
in June after the darkness, swirling snow and ultra-cold 
temperatures of the Antarctic winter had closed in, sealing off the 
Amundsen-Scott research station and its inhabitants to the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the only doctor among staff at the domed research  
station and had been treating herself with chemotherapy since July, 
when medical supplies were dropped to her in another daring mercy 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen was unavailable for comment following her rescue, shying  
away from the international media attention focused on her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has become a public figure through circumstance and not  
through choice,'' National Science Foundation director Rita Colwell 
said in a written statement, asking the media to respect Nielsen's 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before she noticed the lump, Nielsen would regale her parents  
with letters about her friendships at the research station and the 
need to do just about everything -- even performing emergency dental 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the rescue operation was possibly the earliest  
ever post-winter flight to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane carried extra fuel for the six-hour, 1,600-mile round  
trip from McMurdo, giving it the capacity to circle over the pole 
if visibility was too poor to land. The precaution, however, proved 
unnecessary.
