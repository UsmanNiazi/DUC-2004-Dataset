	TROY, Ohio (AP) -- The sister-in-law of the doctor rescued from  
the South Pole says having her family nearby will be as important 
as any medical procedure during treatment for a lump on her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Cahill said Sunday that her husband, Eric, and his  
brother, Scott, traveled to New Zealand to be reunited with their 
sister, Dr. Jerri Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen was rescued Saturday from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole  
Research Station, where she had been treating herself for the lump 
for months. Flights to and from the pole are impossible for much of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between she and the family, to not be able to  
physically comfort her, has been hard,'' Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Bob Bullock of Stratton Air National Guard in Scotia, N.Y.,  
would not say today whether Nielsen has returned to the United 
States yet. He would say only that his agency's mission ended 
Saturday morning when the second of the two planes landed at 
Christchurch, New Zealand, bringing Nielsen that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sick and would like to go the hospital and learn my  
fate,'' Nielsen said in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek shortly 
before her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am waiting to get off the Ice and find out what is going on.  
We are isolated here, as you know,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Communication with Nielsen was limited to e-mail and calls  
through ham radio operators when she was at the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 47, of Youngstown, discovered the lump in June. She had  
been treating herself with chemotherapy since July, when medical 
supplies were dropped to her in another risky flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and  
begin self-treatment with chemotherapy. She then e-mailed 
photographs of slide samples of the tumor to doctors in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	At her request, authorities have not released details of her  
diagnosis or condition. Newsweek, citing a National Science 
Foundation source, reported that after Nielsen completed the first 
round of chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. 
</P>
<P>
	She was rescued by a special military plane that made the flight  
to the domed station. The flight was made possible by an easing in 
the Antarctic winter temperature to 58 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Cahill said Nielsen kept busy with her  
duties up until she left the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't have time to focus on her condition at all. She's a  
very giving person,'' she said.
