	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An Indiana doctor who helped a South Pole  
physician treat herself for breast cancer until she could be safely 
brought out says the long-distance medical aid was ``difficult, 
sometimes frustrating and emotional work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen was rescued last weekend from the  
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Center after treating herself 
for breast cancer for nearly five months under the supervision of 
Indiana University Hospital cancer specialist Dr. Kathy Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	By e-mail and videoconference, the two and other doctors  
considered whether Nielsen could perform surgery on herself, 
debated the risks of a subzero air drop of medical supplies and 
exchanged information on how to administer Nielsen's drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 47 -- who is from the Youngstown, Ohio, area -- was  
brought to the hospital for a medical evaluation and released 
Wednesday. Her destination was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't want details on her condition revealed, and the only  
public statement she made this week was to confirm the breast lump 
had been diagnosed as cancer and add, ``My spirit is strong.'' But 
she did give Miller permission to discuss her past treatment with 
The Indianapolis Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller told the newspaper it was hard to supervise Nielsen's  
self-treatment from 11,600 miles away with only the help of 
undependable videoconferencing technology and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was almost to the point that if I didn't have an e-mail from  
Jerri every day, I started to get worried,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, the only doctor at the station, discovered a lump in  
her breast in late spring -- when winter is approaching in the 
Antarctic and bad weather had closed down traffic into and out of 
the South Pole. Her case was referred to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had all the same questions and worries as all my other  
breast cancer patients do,'' Miller said. ``How bad is this? Is it 
going to take my life? What will the treatment involve? Will it 
work? How will we know it works?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women considered whether Nielsen could perform surgery on  
herself to remove the lump. A Soviet doctor removed his own 
appendix at the site in 1961. Miller said doctors decided Nielsen 
couldn't operate extensively enough to do any good. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step was to arrange an air drop of medical equipment  
and supplies, a move Nielsen initially opposed for fear the danger 
to flight crews would outweigh the benefits for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people risking their lives to air drop things to  
me if it doesn't matter and won't save my life,'' Nielsen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller insisted, writing in response: ``There is a real chance  
for long-term survival'' with proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed Nielsen to perform her own biopsy, getting  
tissue samples by inserting a needle into her breast. She e-mailed 
photographs of slide samples of the tumor to doctors in the United 
States, including Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Intravenous chemotherapy began July 23 with a videoconference  
between the South Pole and doctors in the United States. But 
problems dogged the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Nielsen, trained as an emergency physician, applied her  
own tourniquet and helped another South Pole medical worker find 
her vein, her helpers had trouble preparing and administering the 
potent drugs, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, medical staff were still preparing the  
drugs when the audio link to Indianapolis suddenly died. Miller and 
nurse LaTrice Haney had to write down instructions and hold them up 
to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me realize it's hard to describe every step that you  
do,'' said Haney. ``You feel supportive, and at the same time, you 
feel helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen was ultimately rescued when the Antarctic winter  
relented slightly, making it warm enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- 
to risk a flight.
