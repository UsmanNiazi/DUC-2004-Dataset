	SCOTIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two National Guard cargo planes took off for  
the South Pole on Wednesday to pick up a 47-year-old doctor who 
discovered a lump in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, the only physician at the South Pole research  
station, is believed to have been treating herself with 
chemotherapy since mid-July, when drugs and medical equipment were 
air-dropped for her in a risky emergency flight during the middle 
of the howling Antarctic winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation, which operates the research  
station, would not release any information about Ms. Nielsen's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement doctor is also on the flight and will be left at  
the domed research station, said foundation spokesman Peter West. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the polar darkness and extreme cold, flights cannot  
take off or land at the South Pole station from March through 
October. The sun rose over the continent in mid-September, and now 
that things are beginning to warm up, the conditions are safer. 
</P>
<P>
	A trip had been scheduled for Oct. 25, but West said waiting  
would have not guaranteed better weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The two C-130 aircraft left for McMurdo Station on the edge of  
Antarctica to wait for weather conditions that would allow the 
final, 800-mile leg of the trip, said Maj. Robert Bullock of the 
New York National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take five days to reach McMurdo. One plane will then  
continue on when weather permits and the other will be on stand-by, 
Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because temperatures will be about 65 degrees below zero, the  
plane will stay on the ground at the South Pole only long enough to 
pick up Ms. Nielsen and drop off the other doctor and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for Antarctica last November, Nielsen lived in  
the Youngstown, Ohio, area. Her assignment at the station was to 
have ended in November.
