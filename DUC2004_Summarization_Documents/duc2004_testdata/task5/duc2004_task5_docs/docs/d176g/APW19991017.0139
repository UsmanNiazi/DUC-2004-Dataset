<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Returning to U.S. </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The doctor who gave herself chemotherapy for a  
lump on her breast she discovered while at the South Pole said 
shortly before her rescue that she was anxious about her prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sick and would like to go the hospital and learn my  
fate,'' Dr. Jerri Nielsen said in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek 
a few days before a daring air mission evacuated her from the U.S. 
National Science Foundation's South Pole research station. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, was rescued Saturday by a crew  
from the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old discovered a lump in her breast in June, which  
is wintertime in the Antarctic. An air drop of medical supplies in 
July allowed her to begin treating herself with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She performed her own biopsy and then e-mailed photographs of  
slide samples to doctors in the United States, Newsweek reported. 
At her request, the National Science Foundation has not released 
details of her diagnosis or condition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Newsweek, citing an Science Foundation source, reports in  
its October 25 issue that after Nielsen completed the first round 
of chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. The 
magazine released a copy of the story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures finally thawed enough last week for a transport  
plane to land at the station, evacuate her and drop off another 
doctor to care for the 41 people living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's sister-in-law, Diana Cahill, said Nielsen was flying  
to the United States on Sunday with her brothers, who met her at a 
stopover in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between she and the family, to not be able to  
physically comfort her, has been hard,'' said Cahill.
