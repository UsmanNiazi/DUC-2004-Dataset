 &HT;    Rescuers' safety stirs concern

   ELIZABETH TWP., Miami County _ Dr. Jerri Nielsen, stranded at
the South Pole with a lump in her breast, isn't the only person
dominating her brother Eric's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The family's worried about the pilot and the other men involved
in the rescue effort, said Eric's wife, Diana Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   Miami County resident Eric Cahill and his brother Scott of
Richmond, Va., are in Christchurch, New Zealand, where they hope to
reunite with their sister in a few days. Hostile polar weather has
so far delayed any possibility of rescuing Nielsen, who has been
using medical supplies dropped during a daring mid-July flyover to
self-administer chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers are currently poised to launch a rescue attempt from
McMurdo, a scientific station on the Antarctic coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're risking their lives to save his sister,'' Diana Cahill
said. ``Of course, (Eric) wants them to do it on the one hand, but
on the other hand, he wouldn't want anything terrible to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of rescuing Nielsen, the only doctor among a
41-member international research crew at the Amundsen-Scott South
Pole research station, are good, according to a spokesman for the
pilots who will fly the hundreds of miles from McMurdo to the pole
station and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence level is quite high on this mission. If the
weather is within our limits, there's no reason why this mission
should not be successful,'' said Major Bob Bullock, spokesman for
the 109th Air Lift Wing of the New York Air National Guard, the
unit undertaking the rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said the minimum temperature needed to make the 6
1/2-hour round trip is minus 58 degrees. Flying at lower
temperatures could result in fuel-starved engines and
malfunctioning hydraulic systems as fluids vital to aircraft
operations thicken.
</P>
<P>
   The LC-130 Hercules cargo plane prepared to rescue Nielsen is
the largest ski-equipped plane in the world, with two 22-foot main
skis and another 10-foot ski beneath its nose. Should the plane
land successfully on the South Pole research station's ice-carved
runway, its four propellers will remain running as Nielsen boards
and her replacement doctor exits before the plane departs for
McMurdo _ all within 20 to 30 minutes, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the risk is associated with a landing,'' Bullock said.
``When the aircraft is on the ground, the part of the aircraft
that's on the ground conducts cold up into the rest of the
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   One of only seven of its kind, the LC-130 Hercules cargo plane
that will attempt to rescue Nielsen can carry up to 60 people, or
about 45,000 pounds of cargo, Bullock said. Only six air crew
members and two or three medical personnel will make the flight, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Cahills have remained in touch with Nielsen via e-mail
during the long Antarctic winter, which is only now beginning to
break. Temperatures at the pole station were minus 69 degrees
Wednesday, forcing crews to wait until at least today to make the
rescue attempt.
