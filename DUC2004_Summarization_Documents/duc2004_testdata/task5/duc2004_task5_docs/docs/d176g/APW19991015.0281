<HEADLINE> Plane To Attempt South Pole Rescue </HEADLINE>

	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A U.S. military plane left the  
Antarctic coast Saturday after temperatures rose enough for a 
mission to rescue an American doctor with breast cancer symptoms 
from the South Pole, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flight took off at 9:27 a.m. (4:27 p.m. EDT Friday),''  
said Capt. Victor Hines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, an LC-130 Hercules from the New York Air National  
Guard's 109th Airlift Wing, was expected to take three hours to 
reach the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station, a dimpled 
dome in the polar snow and ice that houses 41 researchers from the 
U.S. National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Hercules arrives -- landing on skis on a strip carved  
out of the polar ice -- its four propeller engines will be kept 
turning to prevent them cooling down and freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup of Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, was expected to take 20  
minutes. During that time, the crew will also drop off a 
replacement doctor to the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue was launched from McMurdo station on Antarctica's  
coast after temperatures at the South Pole rose high enough for the 
Hercules to fly there. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,600-mile roundtrip to the pole and back to McMurdo was  
expected to take 6 1/2 hours. When Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, 
returns to McMurdo she will likely be flown to New Zealand and then 
to the United States for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	She has reportedly been treating herself with chemotherapy since  
medical supplies were dropped to her in July, after she discovered 
the lump during the polar winter. No landings are possible at the 
pole during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation, at Nielsen's request, has  
refused to disclose details of her condition or her travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
	As well as its usual crew of six, the Hercules also was carrying  
a senior mission commander, a two-member Medivac team and two 
maintenance personnel as well as a replacement doctor to take 
Nielsen's place at the polar station. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was finally launched after days of frustration  
caused by unpredictable polar weather. The type of plane involved 
becomes difficult to handle in extremely low temperatures as 
hydraulic systems operate sluggishly below minus 58 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Hercules planes had to wait for an extra day after arriving  
in southern New Zealand this week before flying to the Antarctic 
coast and were forced to postpone planned rescue attempts on 
Thursday and Friday after temperatures plunged as low as minus 76. 
</P>
<P>
	As one flew to the South Pole, the second remained on standby at  
McMurdo as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amundsen-Scott station cannot be reached by plane during the  
polar winter because of the extremely low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation has -- at Nielsen's request --  
released no information about her condition or travel plans after 
rescue.
