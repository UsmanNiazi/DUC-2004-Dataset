 Internet Guru's Death Shakes Up the Online World  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The sudden death of one of the Internet's founding fathers has
stunned the Web world, but is unlikely to disrupt its
privatization.
<P>
   Jon Postel, who oversaw the intricate computer system for
routing all online traffic and maintaining a lexicon of popular
domain names, died Friday night in Los Angeles from complications
following heart surgery. The ``guardian of the Internet's
infrastructure'' was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The intensely private Postel was director of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which matches popular Internet
addresses with numerical addresses, and he helped broker a
last-minute agreement on the transfer of domain-naming power from
the U.S. government to a nonprofit organization earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gray-haired, bushy bearded Postel struck a
professorial pose and was reclusive, his impact on the flourishing
nationwide network of computers that became the Internet was loud,
according to colleagues and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Postel was an important historical figure in developing
the Net,'' said Jon Englund, organizer of Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the nine-member nonprofit group
that will be responsible for dispensing the five most popular
domain names _ .com, .org, .net, .gov and .edu. ``His impact
affects most Americans today and will continue to touch many in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel played a critical _ and sometimes controversial _ role in
helping stitch a consensus among the disparate factions attempting
to hammer out an agreement on domain names. His plan was criticized
by some, but ultimately Network Solutions, the government
contractor that parcels out domain names, agreed to back it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood the domain-name process had to change and
initiated that process a couple of years ago,'' said Ira Magaziner,
President Clinton's Internet adviser. ``Jon was one of the great
pioneers of the information age and made its infrastructure
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the wizard behind the curtains,'' Magaziner said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Postel's death on the eve of such an historic
transition, many said the plan will continue unabated _ primarily
because of Postel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not likely to have a significant effect,'' said Joe Sims,
a Washington, D.C., attorney who drafted the ICANN proposal with
Postel. ``His ideals and guidance brought us far down the road. He
left us in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ICANN plan, thousands of companies will be eligible to
sign up as registrars, virtually assuring consumers will pay less
than the current $70 fee for naming rights for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ceding domain-naming rights to a broad spectrum of businesses is
in harmony with the Clinton administration's hands-off Internet
policy. White House officials do not want to impede the economic
momentum of the Internet, which has helped spur growth of the
overall U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization will be unique in the world _ a
nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for
administering what is becoming an important global resource,''
Postel wrote in a letter to Commerce Department Secretary William
Daley this month, supporting ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   Postel's death provoked an outpouring of impromptu eulogies from
high-tech circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jon) has left a monumental legacy for all Internauts to
contemplate,'' Internet co-founder Vint Cerf said in a moving
tribute posted throughout the Internet. ``He leaves a legacy of
edited documents that tell our collective Internet story, including
not only the technical but also the poetic and whimsical as well.''
