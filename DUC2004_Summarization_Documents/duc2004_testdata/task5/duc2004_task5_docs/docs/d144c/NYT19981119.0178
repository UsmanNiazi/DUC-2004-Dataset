SOME WORRY ABOUT GOVERNMENT'S POLICY-MAKING ROLE IN CYBERSPACE

<P>
   An altogether perplexing mix technologists, business folk,
engineers, lobbyists, and lawyers gathered Saturday in Cambridge,
Mass. to discuss the future of the Internet. The occasion was the
first public meeting of the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or ICANN _ the new nonprofit California corporation that
will probably be granted ultimate authority by the US government
over all technical aspects of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN was created last month by Jon Postel. The research
scientist at University of California's Information Sciences
Institute is regarded by many as one of the inventors of the 'Net.
For more than 20 years Postel had presided over the Internet's most
technical decisions, recording decisions that were made by rough
consensus and helping to resolve conflicts when they arose.
</P>
<P>
   Postel also decided who would run the Internet's
``nameservers,'' which connect users to the sites they are looking
for, and how 'Net addresses would be apportioned to governments,
companies, universities, organizations, and even individuals.
Postel walked into this job, friends say, because he was better at
recording facts and figures than the other Internet pioneers of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid commercialization of the Internet in recent
years, many people felt that it was inappropriate for the
Internet's ultimate arbiter to be a single individual. Some people
wanted to see this function performed by some kind of elected body.
Others, reasoning that governments can't be trusted, thought the
Internet's ultimate authority should rest in the hands of private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year the federal National Telecommunications and
Information Administration has wrestled with this question. NTIA
put out two papers requesting proposals. Over the summer it
received three responses, one from Postel, one from an organization
called the Boston Working Group, and one from the Open Root Server
Confederation. There was a lot of conflict among the proposals, and
many of the participants were looking forward to a hashing out the
details in a public form.
</P>
<P>
   Then the unthinkable happened: Jon Postel died on Oct. 16 from a
burst aorta.
</P>
<P>
   Since Postel's death things have moved quickly. On Oct. 20, the
Commerce Department wrote a letter to ISI, Postel's home
institution, saying the United States intends to move carefully but
expeditiously to private management of the Internet address system
and essentially gave ISI the green light to set up ICANN. Shortly
thereafter a Washington attorney named Jon Sims telephoned 10
individuals, telling them that they had been chosen by Postel to be
ICANN's interim board. Nine agreed. On Oct. 26, the board met in
secret and appointed Esther Dyson, a former journalist who now runs
Edventure Holdings, an venture capital firm, as its interim
chairman. Postel's stature all but guarants his proposal would
ultimately be approved by the government, and his untimely death
has done much to silence public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 14 meeting was supposed to be ICANN's first public
meeting, but no business of any substance was conducted. Instead,
the meeting became a forum in which many people attacked ICANN's
proposed procedures, its mandate, and its very legitimacy.
Attendees demanded to know how ICANN's interim board had been
chosen. Others demanded to know how ICANN would raise money to
conduct business. Still others demanded to know how the
organization would be held accountable for its decisions. And then
there was the question that was on everybody's minds: what gave the
government the power to decide the Internet's future. Shouldn't
that be done democratically by the Internet's users?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had created an electorate to elect us, the question
would have been by what authority are you creating that
electorate?'' said Dyson, shortly after the meeting was called to
order.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat frightening to see Dyson brush aside the
democratic desires of the people attending her meeting. Many people
attending thought that the Internet created the possibility for a
new kind of world-wide direct democracy. But instead, the board's
initial actions made it look like it would just be a reformation of
20th century power structures.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, government of the United States, reportedly the
greatest democracy on earth, seems to think that policy decisions
in cyberspace are best decided by private corporations that are
appointed by government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's bylaws prohibit the public from attending
meetings, permit secret votes, and provide no way for the public to
appeal ICANN's decisions,'' wrote commentator Declan McCullagh in
an article that appeared in Wired News.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who didn't bother to attend the meeting largely
regard the controversy surrounding ICANN's creation as a tempest in
a teapot. After all, they say, the real control of the Internet is
already in the hands of companies like MCI, Sprint, and AT&AMP;T _ the
companies that actually operate the Internet's long-distance links.
</P>
<P>
   But control over directories and protocols is real power, as the
world is just beginning to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys will have a choke-hold on the economy of the US and
the world,'' said Dan Parisi, who runs the pornographic Web site
Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi has learned first-hand just how much control an
organization like ICANN will potentially wield. His Web site,
easily mistaken for a site operated by the US government, has long
been a thorn in the side of anti-pornography advocates and the feds
alike. And indeed, Whitehouse.coms makes frequent reference to the
first couple, going so far as to put their faces on the
pornographic photographs of sex models. But the US government has
never been able to shut down the site, largely because it does not
have a trademark on the word Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Parisi noticed something odd: the number of
visitors coming to his site dropped by 90 percent. Parisi's
technical staff said that something was wrong with the Internet's
nameservers --- a new problem that was only affecting his
particular Web site. But the Internet's operators at Network
Solutions blamed Parisi's crew. The problem kept up for two weeks,
costing Parasi more than $50,000. Then, just as quietly as it had
started, the problem ended and the situation returned to normal.
Was this truly a technical glitch, or a warning? There is no way to
tell for sure.
