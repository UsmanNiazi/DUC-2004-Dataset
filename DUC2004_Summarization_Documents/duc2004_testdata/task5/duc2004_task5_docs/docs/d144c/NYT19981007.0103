CONTROL OF DOMAIN NAMES ON INTERNET DRAWS ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration this week enters the
final phase of what has been a highly contentious effort to hand
administration of the Internet over to an international nonprofit
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   A group led by Jon Postel, a founder of the Internet, presented
the government on Friday with its proposal for creating a
California-based entity called the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization will be unique in the world _ a
nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for
administering what is becoming an important global resource,''
Postel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The larger significance of the proposal is that it lays out the
final privatization of the Internet by the federal government,
which financed decades of Internet development as a communication
tool for military and academic researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate issue is forming an equitable plan for
creating and distributing ``top-level domain names,'' the
identifiers like .com and .org that identify what type of resource
an Internet address is. The .com top-level domain, for example,
signifies a commercial address.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, domain names have been administered by the U.S.
government _ at first directly and in more recent years under a
government contract granting a registration monopoly to Network
Solutions, a corporation based in Herndon, Va. A number of private
companies have demanded that they be allowed to compete with
Network Solutions in the lucrative business of registering domain
names, while Europeans and Asian have complained that their
interests are underrepresented in the development and
administration of domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which
is newly incorporated, nominated nine interim board members to help
finish writing bylaws and create a permanent 19-member board
responsible for introducing competition and a recognition of
international interests to the domain registration system. Under
the proposal, the corporation would also make decisions on how and
when to add new top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-awaited revamping plan by Postel's group still has
a number of critics, and the Clinton administration has not yet
ironed out the details for a smooth transition of crucial property
and customer records from Network Solutions to the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Magaziner, the adviser to President Clinton who has been
overseeing the transition to private governance of the Internet,
had hoped to have a plan in place by the time the government's
contract with Network Solutions expired on Oct. 1. But a
last-minute breakdown in negotiations prompted the Commerce
Department to extend the old contract for one week. It is now set
to expire on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another extension is likely, since the government will take 10
days of public comments on the plan and two proposed variations
before it moves forward. Many critics say the Postel plan was
hammered out behind closed doors, despite the administration's call
for a process that strove for consensus among the international
groups that have an interest in how the network is governed.
</P>
<P>
   One contention about the Postel plan concerns whether the new
agreement would unfairly strip Network Solutions of the lucrative
business it has built as the monopoly registrar of top-level
domains. Company spokesmen declined comment beyond saying
negotiations with the government were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   A larger issue about the plan, though, is whether there would be
proper fiscal controls and long-term checks on the powers of the
proposed new board, whose members would be largely appointed by the
professional, advocacy and commercial organizations that finance
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substantive problem with it is that it is completely
obtuse to questions of separation of powers and limits and
accountability,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School
professor who has been critical of what he sees as a secretive
process for drafting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect corporation if you trusted the board members,''
Lessig said, ``just like any Communist government is perfect if you
trust the Communist government.''
</P>
<P>
   An international coalition of associations representing a range
of Internet interests has filed its own bylaw proposals, which
would make the corporation based on membership rather than one
whose board members are largely selected by the organizations that
finance it.

<P>
   In another objection, J. William Semich, president and chief
financial officer of .NU Domain, a registrar of second-level domain
names, said that the proposed bylaws lacked the proper budget
reviews and spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Secretary of Commerce William Daley, Postel
acknowledged the continuing opposition to his plan. He said that
while the organization had been formally incorporated, it had not
yet elected a board or adopted bylaws and did not plan to do so
until the completion of a Commerce Department review of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many challenges left for the days and years to come,
but the consensus that developed around these documents provides
considerable promise that those challenges can also be overcome,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed interim board includes representatives of
telecommunications, Internet and academic interests from the United
States, Japan, Australia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed interim board members are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Geraldine Capdeboscq, executive vice president for strategy,
technology and partnerships at Groupe Bull, an international
information systems group based in France.
</P>
<P>

based in Seattle.
