INTERNET CITIZENS DEBATE HOW TO FORM ONLINE UNION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the times that try a cyberpatriot's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jon Postel, who has served as the unflaggingly serene
citizen-sentry of the Internet's address system since he began
keeping track of it on a piece of notebook paper in 1969. But
Postel is weary these days, and a little bit grumpy _ and not
because the Internet has doubled in size yet again in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Postel, a University of Southern California
researcher, has recently been anointed a founding father of the
network's nascent political structure _ a move toward Internet
``self-governance'' that is being propelled by various
governmental, commercial and social forces.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, Postel's work has been supported by a
combination of contracts from the federal government and consensus
by the Internet's ad hoc technical community. But now, as a de
facto delegate to what is shaping up as a constitutional convention
in cyberspace, Postel suddenly finds himself being accused of
seizing illegitimate power, threatened with lawsuits and bombarded
in e-mail wars.
</P>
<P>
   His critics include Jim Dixon, president of Euro Internet
Service Providers Association, a trade group of 600 Internet
companies in Europe. ``You have a small group of people asking that
they be given a large amount of power simply because they've been
there for a long time,'' complains Dixon, noting that Europe wants
more say in how the Internet will be run.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns are shared by many Internet industry leaders
outside the United States, who have made their feelings known to
Postel and the U.S. government via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Postel cannot help but feel besieged. ``I'd rather be doing the
technical stuff,'' he said recently with a sigh. ``But there are so
many questions that need to get answered. How do we form a
representative board? How do we make it international? How do we
find enough agreement to move forward?''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being Postel's private agony, these are among the
questions that are bound to be debated at a meeting near Washington
this week, at another in Geneva later in July and at various other
caucuses, conferences and online sessions this summer. The
partisans of the Net are working toward a Sept. 30 deadline for the
U.S. government to hand over control of a key portion of the
Internet to an as-yet-unformed nonprofit international group.
</P>
<P>
   Even for many Internet users who do not care much about the
specific job at hand _ determining who gets to register whom for
which types of Internet addresses _ the need to create a governing
system for that task has given a sense of urgency and common cause
to representatives from the government and industry, as well as the
libertarian technologists who have historically supervised the
Internet. Though they may have competing goals, all share a belief
in free-flowing communication and in the value of electronic
commerce, which the Department of Commerce recently reported was
growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is sure how it should work, the idea is that a
uniquely participatory medium like the Internet _ one that
transcends national borders and whose fast-evolving technology can
be shaped to fit social policy _ ought to be able to come up with
its own semiofficial political structure. Regulation by more
traditional means, the thinking goes, would stifle electronic
commerce and the free flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are sufficiently high to elicit a recent emotional
appeal from David Farber, a professor of computer science at the
University of Pennsylvania, who is a widely respected e-mail
pamphleteer with nearly 25,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow it, the result will be governance by governments
with all the negatives that holds for the future evolution of the
net,'' Farber recently wrote to his e-mail constituents. ``What do
we do. We could act grown up!! We could coordinate the meetings and
make it appear like we are organized. I wonder if the net
establishment is indeed willing to be grown up, or will they fight
till there is nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   His recent missive was a cry from the heart. ``This is a
defining moment,'' Farber said in an interview. ``If we can't pull
it together on something like this, governments are going to get
together and decide this is too important to their economic health
to leave in the hands of chaos. They'll start writing treaties, and
we'll end up with a very slow mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber is himself an Internet founding father. He was Postel's
thesis adviser in 1969 and assigned his student the task of
cataloguing Internet addresses. That academic exercise eventually
became a full-time job as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,
financed by the Department of Defense. While Network Solutions
Inc., a Reston, Va., company, has had an exclusive government
contract to register addresses under the most popular domains _
``.com,'' ``.net'' and ``.org,'' _ Postel has been responsible for
ensuring that each address corresponds to a unique string of digits
that all of the Internet's computers can recognize.
</P>
<P>
   And now Postel finds himself being swept toward that Sept. 30
deadline _ the date the Clinton administration recently set for
handing over control of the distribution of Internet addresses to
whatever international nonprofit group has formed by then. The
administration's report on the matter earlier this month prompted
the announcement of at least two meetings by competing factions,
with others rumored to be in the works. One, to take place in
Reston, Va., begins on Wednesday. The other, in Geneva, will start
July 21.
</P>
<P>
   With the administration and industry seeming to have more faith
in technology and market forces to regulate cyberspace than
legislation, the effort to supervise Internet addresses has become
the first test of the self-governance movement.
