   When Dr. Stephen Crocker sent e-mail to his 20-year-old
daughter, Melissa, about the death last Friday of his fellow
Internet pioneer, Dr. Jonathan B. Postel, 55, he decided to explain
to her his friend's significance in the world of computer
networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're familiar with the Internet addresses, of course,''
Crocker, 54, wrote in his note, which was part primer, part
tribute. ``Jon set up an organized way to keep track of Internet
addresses and the many other sets of numbers needed to run the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocker continued to catalog Postel's technical achievements,
describing how his modest, behind-the-scenes work had evolved into
the crucial Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. He closed with
this: ``He was always balanced, fair and conscientious _ one of the
good people who kept things working.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker's missive to his daughter, a junior in college who uses
the Net every day but knows little about its technical
underpinnings, was intended to give her a glimpse into what his
generation did to lay the foundation for a network that she and her
contemporaries now consider one of life's necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Postel and Crocker were members of the Internet old guard, a
cadre of computer researchers who, when young, had strong opinions
and nothing to lose. They began thinking about computer networks in
the 1960s, when few in the corporate sphere seemed interested.
Paying no attention to the indifference, they built their network
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   More than scientists, they were inventors. For his part, Postel
came up with a method for organizing and tracking network addresses
while he was a graduate student at the University of California at
Los Angeles. In those days, the Net was so small that his project
was a little like documenting the house numbers on his own street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny because everything was in such a small volume and
everyone knew everyone,'' said Danny Cohen, a former colleague of
Postel at the Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, a
branch of the University of Southern California where Postel worked
for 21 years. ``What was the point of documenting it if you could
talk to the guy who did it? Jon had the vision to see how important
it was. So when the network started growing, the infrastructure was
in place and it didn't collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Postel's projects was to edit a series of technical
notes for the Network Working Group, which was developing
communications protocols, the rules by which computers converse.
Crocker, inordinately courteous, had written the first note in the
late 60s and called it ``Request for Comments'' because he wasn't
sure who was really in charge of this nascent network and didn't
want to offend anyone by sounding too official. The notes came to
be called RFCs and quickly became the Net's de facto bylaws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not longer after Crocker started the RFCs, Postel took on the
volunteer job of editing them. Nearly 2,500 RFCs have been
produced, and Postel kept some of the earliest ones in his home and
office.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with later waves of well-groomed Net millionaires,
Postel favored a long bushy beard and sandals. His office was a
mess, but his maintenance of the Internet's addresses, through the
federally financed Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which he
ran, was meticulous.
</P>
<P>
   He did not attend conferences devoted to such topics as online
business models. Instead, he attended meetings of the Internet
Engineering Task Force and the Internet Society. And his presence
at such gatherings was crucial. Over the years, he became a Net
deity, acting as a quiet arbiter when technical disputes were at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when the Net is synonymous in most people's minds with
a visual, commercial World Wide Web, full of sound, music, video
and stock prices, it still reflects the personalities and
proclivities of those who built it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that nobody actually owns the Net is no accident. It
belonged to those who built it and ran it. People like Postel
fought to keep its standards open and free, which enabled hundreds
of thousands of people to build on those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Postel believed that he was a public servant above all. He could
have become a millionaire many times over but always decided
against it. ``There are aspects of what I've done that are
positions of public trust,'' he once said in an interview. ``I
don't feel it would be right for me to start a company to profit
from those activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a close friend of Postel's, said that even though Postel,
through his work, made it possible for the Net to grow
exponentially, he had mixed feelings about the Internet's success.
Occasionally, Cohen said, he and Postel and others mourned the
passing of the Net as they once knew it, a cozy place where you
knew pretty much everyone else who was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked many times about the disaster of success,'' Cohen
said. ``The worst disaster that can happen is success beyond your
expectations. Things aren't as nice as they used to be. Now there
are all kinds of people you don't know and all kinds of different
agendas.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Postel is not forgotten. He is enough of a legend that after his
death, eulogies and tributes, and even black ribbons, appeared all
over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shabbir J. Safdar, 31, a political strategist in Washington who
depends heavily on the Internet, said that although he had never
met Postel, he was well aware of his contributions. ``I met him
only in the sense that everyone else met him,'' he said. ``We we're
living on top of his work. Everything we do touches his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Safdar said few of his friends shared his appreciation of
Postel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Mockapetris, who worked with Postel to create the
Internet's Domain Name System in the early 1980s at Information
Sciences Institute, said the generational difference became
apparent to him recently when he received e-mail from someone
requesting the specifications for a particular protocol he and a
group of others had written.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped all over him for his breach of Net etiquette,'' said
Mockapetris, who is 49. ``He should have just gone to the RFC
instead of wasting 30 people's time.'' Mockapetris asked the
offender what his excuse for such a breach of etiquette might be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ten,'' was the response. &QL;
