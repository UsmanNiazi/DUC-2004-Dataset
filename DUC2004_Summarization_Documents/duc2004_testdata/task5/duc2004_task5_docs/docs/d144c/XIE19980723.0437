<HEADLINE> Jon Postel Awarded ITU Silver Medal for Key Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) Wednesday awarded Dr Jon Postel the
ITU silver medal for his central role in the success story of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The medal was awarded on behalf of ITU Secretary-General Dr
Pekka Tarjanne in recognition of Postel's outstanding contribution
to the development of the Global Information Infrastructure,
through his management of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA).
</P>
<P>
In the world of Internet governance, ITU said, few
organizations play as critical a role as the IANA. Unique numbers
and unique names of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) must be
assigned and managed in an orderly fashion to enable the
functioning of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
That has been the IANA's task from the very beginning of the
Internet. The IANA has been managing the root of the DNS to
promote stability and robustness and has ensured that every
Internet computer had a unique IP number. To this end, the IANA
has been allocating blocks of numerical addresses to regional IP
registries throughout the world which in turn issue them to
Internet service providers and users.
</P>
<P>
The IANA also assigns and maintains a registry of the values
used for several technical parameters including protocol numbers,
port numbers, and others which must also be unique for the
Internet to work.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the on-going number assignments have continued to
work effectively despite the phenomenal growth of the Internet
which now boasts of 24.7 million hosts, is a credit to the
architects of the system and to the IANA which administers it.
</P>
<P>
Postel, currently a researcher at the University of Southern
California's (USC) Information Sciences Institute (ISI), is a
legendary figure in the world of the Internet.
