	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Jon Postel, the Internet pioneer who wielded
enormous influence managing technical details of the global
computer network, has died of complications from heart surgery in
Los Angeles, friends in Washington said Saturday. He was 55.
	   Postel, a crucial player in the future of the Internet, died
Friday night while recovering from surgery to replace a leaking
heart valve, said Vint Cerf, a senior vice president for MCI
Worldcom Inc. who worked closely with Postel.
	   The death also was announced Saturday at an Internet conference
in Barcelona, said Bill Semich, the president of .nu domain,
another Internet company.
	   Postel's death comes at a critical juncture for the Internet,
with the U.S. government in the midst of largely turning over
management of the worldwide network to a nonprofit group that
Postel helped organize.
	   Though Postel worked behind the scenes and was hardly known
outside high-tech circles, his role as director of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority allowed the Internet to match unique
numerical addresses for computers on the global network with its
millions of Web addresses, such as www.ap.org.
	   So powerful was Postel that ``The Economist'' once dubbed him
``god'' of the Internet.
	   ``Jon was a very private person and didn't seek the limelight at
all,'' said Cerf, who attended high school with Postel in
California. ``He preferred to exercise his stewardship role in a
very quiet but competent way.''
	   Earlier this year, Postel drew sharp criticism but demonstrated
his influence when he redirected half the Internet's 12
directory-information computers to his own system. He told U.S.
officials afterward he was running a test to see how smoothly such
a transition could be made.
	   Cerf said Postel underwent a heart-valve replacement in 1991,
but the replacement value started to leak about 10 days ago. He was
quickly hospitalized for surgery and was recovering when he died
suddenly.
	   ``One minute he was alert and laughing about a joke, and the
next minute he was gone,'' Cerf said. ``It was very fast.''
	   Postel, who was unmarried with no children, was intensely
private. When a recent trade publication profiled him and told him
readers were interested in his personal life, he answered: ``If we
tell them, they won't be interested anymore.''
	   Cerf said Postel is survived by a brother, Mort Postel, who
lives in Los Angeles.
