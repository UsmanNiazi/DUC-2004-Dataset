U.S. EXPECTED TO BACK SHIFT IN INTERNET ADMINISTRATION

<P>
   Clearing the way for the global Internet to be governed without
governments, the Clinton administration is expected Tuesday to
commit itself to hand over the administration of the computer
network to a nonprofit corporation under a proposal that has won
broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Ira C. Magaziner, the adviser to President Clinton who has been
overseeing the contentious transition of what has traditionally
been a U.S. government function to the international private
sector, said the administration's endorsement would depend on the
adoption of certain amendments advocated in rival proposals.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is who will decide how to dole out names and addresses
like those with the suffixes ``.com'' and ``.net'' among
cyberspace's rapidly growing population, and who, if anyone, will
make money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposed organization is seen as a model for
policy making for a medium that crosses geographical as well as
socially constructed boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's long-awaited decision comes in the wake of
the death last week of the plan's key proponent, Jonathan Postel,
at age 55.
</P>
<P>
   Postel, who died of complications after undergoing heart
surgery, was one of the Internet's most revered technical wizards.
He had administered the infrastructure of the Internet address
system under a federal government contract since he invented it 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months he had sought to build a consensus beyond the
ranks of technologists to include corporate, nonprofit and
international interests in forming a new body that would make
policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner said the announcement, originally planned for Monday,
was delayed as he and Commerce Department staff members called
around to see if support for the new entity, known as the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, would hold
firm without Postel to lend his considerable credibility to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   But as electronic eulogies for Postel circulated over the
Internet, it seemed his coalition would remain intact, albeit with
some adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody anticipated this would happen, and Jon will be sorely
missed, but it underscores the necessity of making this
transition,'' Magaziner said. ``Part of the design was to move
beyond depending on the structure that was based on the Internet's
historical origins.''
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles to true consensus, however, remain.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based corporation proposed by Postel has been
criticized from several quarters for not providing a structure that
is democratic enough.
</P>
<P>
   Governments in Latin America and Africa, for example, complained
that their regions were not represented on the corporation's
proposed board.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals submitted to the Commerce Department by dissenting
international coalitions argued that the board should be held more
accountable to the Internet's diverse constituents and that proper
financial controls needed to be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., which has distributed
domain names under an exclusive contract from the government for
the last five years and would see its monopoly end when the plan
goes into effect, has also objected to the Icann proposal. The
company generated revenue of $37 million in the first half of this
year by registering names with the ``.com,'' ``.net,'' ``.org'' and
``.edu'' suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner said that the administration's consent to the Icann
proposal would hinge on its supporters' reaching an agreement with
those calling for a more open organization.

<P>
   But he may also face opposition in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Magaziner and to Commerce Secretary William M.
Daley last week, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the
Commerce Committee, criticized what he called the ``closed door''
process initiated by Postel's group.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley suggested that the proposed board be made up of a
majority of U.S representatives and asked for an explanation of the
legal basis for turning over control to the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the manner in which the process of
privatizing the governance of the DNS has apparently unraveled,''
Bliley wrote. ``A loss of credibility in the Internet community at
large will seriously undermine the ability of the new corporation
to administer the Domain Name System and the stability of the
Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Heath, chairman of the Internet Society, a nonprofit
coalition of the network's technical organizations, disputed
Bliley's version of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be blunt: it appears to me that his office might have
been misinformed if not manipulated by people who want to preserve
the status quo, and by that I mean a monopoly of Network
Solutions,'' Heath said. ``Jon never did anything behind closed
doors in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Network Solutions said the company had had ``no
contact with Bliley.''
