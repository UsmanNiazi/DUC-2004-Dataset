   LOS ANGELES _ This US Senate race would have been tight even if
the incumbent wasn't related to Bill Clinton by marriage, even if
she hadn't led the charge against powerful Republicans accused of
sexual misconduct then sidestepped discussion of the president's
behavior for more than seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Now Senator Barbara Boxer finds herself neck-and-neck with her
little-known challenger, Republican state Treasurer Matt Fong.
Although many California voters insist they don't care about her
Clinton connection, either through party affiliation or family,
political observers say the association has to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere she goes, Boxer is asked about Clinton, whose
brother-in-law, Anthony, is married to her daughter. She attacks
Fong's opposition to raising the minimum wage, and the buzz is
about her position on impeachment proceedings. Discussion of
Clinton's behavior dominated the first quarter of a recent
candidates' debate.
</P>
<P>
   Getting her message out may only get more difficult in the days
ahead. Desperate for fund-raising dollars, Boxer intends to invite
the Clintons to campaign with her this fall. Presidential problems
aside, she says he is still good for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton isn't governing how voters view Boxer, but the first
question she gets is always, `What do you think of the Clinton
controversy?' and `Why haven't you been a big critic of his?'''
said Mark DiCamillo, director of the San Francisco-based Field
Poll, which recently showed Boxer and Fong tied at 45 percent
percent of the vote with 10 percent of the electorate undecided.
``But she already had an extremely partisan image... I think she
has a real problem this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Swept into office by a slim margin during 1992's ``Year of the
Woman,'' the liberal, Bay Area Democrat has long been considered
vulnerable in socially moderate, fiscally more conservative
California. Now, as she told political reporters in Washington last
week, she is in ``the race of my life'' with Fong, who captured
enough of the conservative base to win the June primary but is
generally considered more of a Jack Kemp-style moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong is as close as he is because Barbara Boxer is a very
polarizing figure in California,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``She is not
very popular, and I don't know how she moves those undecided
voters, especially with the static of Bill Clinton and his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Boxer's own problems, Democratic voter turnout is
expected to be low, dampened by disgust over Clinton's initial
denial that he had an adulterous affair with a White House intern.
Last month, Clinton admitted to the nation that he did have a
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. Last week, Boxer took to the
Senate floor to denouce his behavior as ``immoral,'' a late slap
that political analysts say could cost her crucial crossover votes
from Republican women. Fong, a fourth-generation Chinese-American,
could also siphon off the Asian vote which, while small, could
matter in such a tight race, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong is incredibly lucky, but since Barbara was
incredibly lucky last time, who is she to complain?'' said Susan
Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor. ``She
wouldn't have denounced Clinton unless she felt she had to, and I
don't blame her for it. But I don't think it will help her,
particularly since she is going to continue using him for
fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign manager, Rose Kapolczynski, said the
candidate's strong views would have caused a close Senate contest
regardless of the opposition. As she noted, at least one recent
poll put Boxer ahead of Fong, and the movement in others has not
been dramatic despite Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence this is hurting us,'' Kapolczynski said.
``I traveled the state with her in August and the people she was
meeting are not obsessed with the president's problems. They're
more concerned about education, women's right to choose, the
environment... The biggest impact is we can't really get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong stressed that he is running against Boxer, not Clinton. Not
surprisingly, however, he is as happy to play up the Clinton-Boxer
connection on the campaign trail as he is to push a federal tax
reform package that would eliminate capital gains, inheritance
taxes, and ``the IRS as we know it.'' Fong calls Boxer a hypocrite
for aggressively criticizing Republicans accused of sexual
harassment but keeping relatively quiet about Clinton for as long
as possible. An outspoken feminist first elected to represent Marin
County in Congress in 1982, Boxer went after both Clarence Thomas
during his US Supreme Court confirmation hearings and Oregon
Senator Bob Packwood, who was forced to resign after several female
employees accused him of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being an issue in the campaign, it's about her
putting politics over principle by her duplicity in treating
Democrats and Republicans differently...,'' said Fong, a US Air
Force Academy graduate often teased for his wooden speaking manner
and discomfort at the podium. ``In California, as much as the
president dominates the news, I'm not running against the
president. The bottom line is Barbara Boxer can't step away from
Barbara Boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, California voters don't typically pay attention to
elections until the candidates hit the airwaves with millions of
dollars in TV advertising, as both Boxer and Fong are expected to
do this fall. For now, the race could go either way. &UR;  &LR; ``People
don't look at either candidate and see a heavyweight.''
