   &LR;  NORTH HOLLYWOOD - Describing California consumers and gas
station owners as victims, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Wednesday
called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the state's
big oil companies and to meet with local gas station owners who
believe those companies are trying to drive them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of a North Hollywood gas station,
Boxer, surrounded by independent gas station owners, accused Shell
and other major oil companies of conducting a
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also accused oil companies of wanting to take over the
stations operated by franchisees so they could control prices all
the way from the oil fields to the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost two years independent service station operators in
California have been punished for fighting for price fairness for
their customers,'' said Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the big oil companies can't fire their franchisees,
which would violate their contract, they are using a variety of
tactics to increase costs and harass and intimidate their own
franchisees,'' the senator said. ``The big oil companies want these
good people to stay quiet, and if they don't stay quiet they are
driving them out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Corp. Fred Gorell described Boxer's claim of harassment
as totally false: ``We encourage our dealers to speak their minds
on any subject, including gas prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many investigations into gas prices and
consistently they find it is the marketplace at work for any price
increase or decrease,'' said Gorell.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Shell and Equilon did not return messages
requesting any comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fred Dagher, who operates eight Shell stations in
the San Gabriel Valley, since the Shell/Texaco merger in 1998
created Equilon, ``they have made it harder for me to stay in
business.'' Equilon controls the refining and distribution of
gasoline for Shell and Texaco in the western United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken away our rebate programs, our rent has tripled
and they have increased the price that dealers pay for gas, leaving
owners in a position where they can't pass on price cuts to the
consumer,'' said Dagher.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Frio, who operates a Chevron station near Los Angeles
International Airport, said independent operators ''
</P>
<P>
   One of the gas stations at the intersection of Camarillo Street,
Riverside Drive and Tujunga Avenue, which served as the site for
the Boxer news conference, was a Shell station selling unleaded
gasoline for $1.35 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Souheil Bisharart, who was forced to sell his two Shell stations
in Pasadena and Arcadia last year, said if the harassment of
independent dealers continues, both the San Gabriel and the San
Fernando valleys will continue to lose independent gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky, Boxer said
independently owned, branded service stations have long been a
mainstay of California's gasoline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition I ask that you meet with a delegation of
independent service station operators ... so you can hear their
concerns first-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who asked the FTC to investigate anti-competitive oil
company practices in California in March last year, said she hoped
the government's investigation would be concluded by the end of the
year.
