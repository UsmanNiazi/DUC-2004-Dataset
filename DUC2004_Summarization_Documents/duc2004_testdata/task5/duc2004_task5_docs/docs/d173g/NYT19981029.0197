<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Barbara Boxer has moved from the apparent
underdog to front-runner in her hard-fought race for re-election,
according to a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Field Poll shows the Democratic incumbent taking a
9-percentage-point lead over state Treasurer Matt Fong. A similar
poll just three weeks ago showed Boxer trailing by 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the turnaround is largely a result of
Boxer's aggressive television advertising, which has sought to
portray her Republican challenger as an extremist on issues such as
the environment, abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the new poll numbers were out
of step with other recent data showing the race was in a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barbara Boxer believes she's nine points ahead she should
take down her misleading, negative, distorted advertising,''
Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was doing just the opposite _ releasing a new television
commercial Wednesday that combines elements of her other recent
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot targets Fong's opposition to a ban on assault
weapons and Saturday-night specials, his position on limiting
malpractice awards against health maintenance organizations and his
support for a nuclear waste dump in Ward Valley in the Mojave
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   While Fong has criticized Boxer's commercials as misleading,
they appear to be succeeding in defining his somewhat fuzzy image
among voters.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll showed Boxer ahead 51 percent to 42 percent among
likely voters, with 7 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted Oct. 22-27 among 1,102 people of whom 678
were identified as likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in support toward Boxer could have several causes:
President Clinton's apparent popularity after the signing of a new
Middle East peace accord, the president's subsequent trip to
California to campaign for Boxer and the senator's own swings
across the state coupled with her well-publicized news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But in a state where commercials long ago replaced press tours
as the primary form of political communication, Boxer seems to be
leading for one major reason: money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Boxer has outspent Fong 2-1 on commercials
aimed at undermining his carefully-crafted image as a moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements have left Fong reeling and criticizing his
opponent's negative tactics. But with less cash on hand, Fong has
had to focus less on public events and more on private fund-raisers
aimed at rebuilding his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for him to raise money, said Bruce Cain, acting
director of the Institute for Governmental Studies at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``He's getting creamed with
TV ads. My guess is he feels he needs the money to try to respond
to the barrage of TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong has responded with a new 30-second spot featuring his
mother, March Fong Eu, who served for 20 years as California's
secretary of state. The commercial, which began running Tuesday,
attacks Boxer for running a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the former chief elections officer, and a Democrat, I'm
disappointed Barbara Boxer has run a campaign full of lies and
distortion,'' Fong Eu says in the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks are not true. She should be ashamed,'' Fong Eu
said. ``Please reject Barbara Boxer's negative campaign and support
Matt Fong.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer spokesman Roy Behr, who derided the commercial as Fong's
``mommy ad,'' pointed out that Fong Eu shares many of Boxer's views
on such issues as abortion, gun control and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is understandable that a mother would come to the aid of
her son, but on the issues voters are looking at, she agrees with
Barbara Boxer, not Matt Fong,'' Behr said.
