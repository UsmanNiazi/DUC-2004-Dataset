BOXER, GORE SETTING SIGHTS ON MORE GUN LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>

 &LR;   &LR;  Washington _ Now that the Senate has passed modest gun control
measures, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., says she is prepared to
push for far more sweeping firearm restrictions, including a ban on
``Saturday night specials.''
<P>
   Fulfilling the gun lobby's worst fears, Boxer said that
restrictions on gun ownership approved last week, the first gun
control measures passed by the Senate in five years, are just the
beginning of a more comprehensive legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get some commonsense gun legislation passed, we will
put forward more commonsense legislation,'' Boxer said during a
breakfast this week with California reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's comments came as Vice President Al Gore and Democratic
leaders in the House pressed for quick passage of the Senate bill.
Approved in the wake of gun violence at schools in Colorado and
Georgia, the Senate bill would require background checks on buyers
at gun shows, ban the import of high-capacity ammunition magazines,
and prohibit ownership of assault weapons by minors, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was given little chance before the rash of
school violence galvanized public support. In the five years since
Republicans took control of Congress, gun control measures had
never been brought to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everybody realizes enough is enough,'' said Gore, who as
president of the Senate cast a tie-breaking vote on one of the key
measures. ``It is time to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats purposely withheld some of their more controversial
proposals in hopes that more-modest measures would be impossible to
defeat. Like Boxer, Gore said the Senate bill was only a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that even more needs to be done than what was done in
the Senate,'' Gore said. The Clinton administration has proposed a
series of measures including a mandatory three-day waiting period
for handgun purchases and holding parents responsible for their
children's access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans rejected Democratic demands that votes
be held this week. But Republican leaders indicated that they will
take up the matter next month, and are prepared to support most of
the provisions contained in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer presented reporters with her own gun control wish list,
which in addition to a three-day wait period, includes a ban on
``junk guns'' such as Saturday night specials; a ban on gun sales
to minors; a ban on brightly colored guns that resemble toys; a ban
on bullets that can pierce body armor used by police; a limit of
one gun purchase per month; and a law to guarantee local
governments the right to sue gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these are modest, commonsense proposals,'' Boxer said.
``We did the first step, and hopefully we'll do another step.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that she is meeting with a small group of Democratic
senators to plan strategy, and that no timetable for the
introduction of the additional measures has been decided upon. But
she said she expected they would all be introduced before Congress
adjourns at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives at the National Rifle Association declined to
respond to Boxer's proposals. NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre,
testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, said that his
organization supports elements of the Senate bill, but that the
legislation as it is currently fashioned is unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, LaPierre said the NRA is not opposed to
background checks on buyers at gun shows, as long as they are done
instantly. The bill that passed the Senate provides up to three
days to conduct the check, a process that could impede some sales.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the media and ``made-for-TV lawmaking'' for what he
called the perception of the NRA as a ``reckless societal pathogen,
a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution and reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cruel and dangerous lie,'' LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre took issue with a comment made by film director Spike
Lee, who according to a New York newspaper said of NRA President
Charlton Heston: ``Shoot him _ with a .44-caliber Bulldog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unreasonable is when a new level of hate rhetoric
becomes acceptable because it's aimed at honest gun owners,''
LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gun lobby's most persistent arguments against gun
control measures is that any new controls lead down a slipperly
toward a ban on gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she does not support a gun ban, but she would support
mandatory registration of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You register your car. What's the problem registering your
gun?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view any of these as zealotry,'' Boxer added. ``Here's
my goal: I want to make sure that guns are kept away from
criminals, from people with mental problems, and from children.''
