   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton's Senate impeachment trial was
about to begin Thursday, Sen. Barbara Boxer warned that if it
``gets ugly and vicious and out-of-control like it did in the
House, it will cast a pall,'' ensuring that little is accomplished
in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think history is going to view this kindly,'' Boxer
told reporters at a breakfast meeting minutes before the start of
the first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be called a partisan impeachment, a lame-duck
impeachment, a vicious impeachment, an impeachment done by people
who hated the president,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, a staunch Clinton supporter whose daughter Nicole is
married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's younger brother Tony, said she
was disappointed that Senate Republicans apparently have rejected a
bipartisan proposal that would have settled Clinton's fate quickly
without a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said Republican calls for trial testimony from witnesses,
including former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton
confidant Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and several White House aides, could
prolong the proceeding indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican managers who are acting as prosecutors in the
trial are calling for five to 18 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that if witnesses are called, ``no telling how long
it (the trial) will last.'' Comments from one witness could lead to
endless requests for additional witnesses, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the managers of wanting to turn the trial ``into a
circus,'' Boxer said not much legislative work will get done.
``We'll all try to do our work, but this is very difficult. This is
about throwing out a president, overturning an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer repeated her own position in favor of a resolution
censuring Clinton that expresses the sense of the Senate ``that
what he did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Senate's confusion about how to proceed with the
trial ``shows that the conservative right is in control.'' But she
predicted ``some kind of backlash against the Republicans. ``I
think the (voters) are going to remember this.''
