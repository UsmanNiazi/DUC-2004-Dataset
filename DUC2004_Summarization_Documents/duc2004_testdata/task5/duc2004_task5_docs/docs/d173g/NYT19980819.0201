   SAN FRANCISCO _ Saddened. Embarrassed. Disappointed. That's how
Democratic leaders in California described their reactions to
President Clinton's admission of adultery and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   With the November elections approaching, political analysts say
the party should add another adjective: Worried.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the state acknowledge much is at stake in the Nov.
3 general election: several shaky congressional seats, Sen. Barbara
Boxer's job and their first good shot at the governor's office
after 16 years of Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   Long billed as the party's ``No. 1 asset,'' Clinton has raised
millions of dollars for Democrats in California. Now, party
candidates may find themselves tied to a president whose
credibility is under fire by members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a severely weakened president,'' said David Kirp,
professor and former dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``That makes it harder
for him to make one of his hourly stops in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public admission Monday night has put House Democrats
in the tough position of condemning his actions while trying to
avoid undermining his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic candidates said the scandal might have bruised
the president, but had done little to hurt their own bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone was disappointed in the president or turned off by
that, which they would have every reason to be, why would the
president's conduct wash over me?'' said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be any fallout in this district,''
said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco
area. ``I've been impressed with the wisdom of people in the Bay
Area who want to accept the president's admission and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, strategist for the California Democratic Party,
said Clinton remained the party's top asset, and that candidates
would continue to seek his help in raising money.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican political consultants said the president's
televised admission had already cut into his popularity in parts of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton may be seen in San Francisco and West Los Angeles, the
liberal strongholds ... but I'll bet 10 bucks (the party) won't
send him to Stockton or through the Central Valley,'' said GOP
consultant Allen Hoffenblum.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans in Congress have called for Clinton's
resignation or impeachment, but more are withholding judgment until
the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, sends his report
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political analyst Tony Quinn said the scandal wasn't
likely to unseat incumbent House members in safe Democratic
districts. But in more marginal areas, where voter registration is
split, Clinton's troubles could help GOP candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These districts are more middle-of-the-road, more
middle-class,'' Quinn said. ``I don't think voters there will be as
forgiving of lying and things that go along with it, like
obstruction of justice or the hiding of Monica Lewinsky's gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders see two seats, in particular, as up for
grabs: one vacated by retiring Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio, the other
left open by Rep. Jane Harman, who gave up the seat for her
unsuccessful bid to win the Democratic nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio's district in Sacramento is a battleground between two
little-known politicians: Democratic attorney Sandra Dunn and
Republican businessman Doug Ose. Ose hasn't made an issue of the
charges against Clinton, but supporters say the scandal would help
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton does get impeached, that would really demoralize
Democratic voters and make them less likely to turn out,'' said
Peter DeMarco, Ose's press secretary. ``If Clinton isn't impeached,
it would really get Republican voters upset, and that would
increase voter turnout. It's a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The great fear for Democrats is that the public's disgust with
the scandal could drive down voter turnout. Democratic voters
traditionally are less likely to vote on Election Day, and a low
turnout could sink some candidates.

   Republicans see Boxer as particularly vulnerable if Clinton's
support drops. She has close ties to Clinton, often supports the
administration in Senate votes, and her daughter, Nicole, is
married to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Anthony
Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Boxer's opponent, Republican Matt Fong, went on
the attack Tuesday, questioning the senator's moral standards in
accepting funds raised by a president who had admitted lying to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you Matt Fong would not be comfortable with someone
who lied to the American public coming out to raise money for
him,'' said Steve Schmidt, Fong's press secretary. ``We hope
Barbara Boxer has the same high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer spokesman Roy Behr said Fong's attack was likely to
backfire with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer will talk about issues like education, safe
neighborhoods, economic growth,'' Behr said. ``Matt Fong will
apparently be talking about sex scandals. That's a contrast that
will obviously work in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Helen Grieco, president of the National Organization for
Women in California, said Boxer and other candidates should shun
Clinton for his deceit and his treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Boxer use Clinton in a fund-raiser? If I were her
strategist, I would say no,'' Grieco said. ``The president has
shown he lacks moral character. I think as a politician, it's very
important to demonstrate that you know how to pick your friends.''
