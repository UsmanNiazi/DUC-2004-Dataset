IN CALIFORNIA, BOXER RUNS FROM COMPARISONS TO FEINSTEIN

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Within weeks of her inauguration as a U.S.
senator, Democrat Barbara Boxer showed just how different she can
sometimes be from her colleague, Dianne Feinstein, despite pundits
lumping them together during the ``Year of the Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, the six women who had just been elected to the
Senate were asked whether Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who had been
accused of sexually harassing more than a dozen women, should
resign. While five of the six, including Feinstein, urged caution,
one senator was not ready for deep introspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he ought to resign,'' Boxer said that Jan. 18, while
the Packwood investigation was still going on. ``What is to come
will be very painful and it would be best for him, the women and
the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein bristle when they are compared.
</P>
<P>
   But they share many bonds, like being elected at the same time
(Feinstein in a special election), becoming the first two women to
represent the same state in the Senate, and they are both champions
of women's issues and Democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   While their voting records on many key issues are remarkably
similar, they differ most in personal style.
</P>
<P>
   It's that ephemeral issue of style, some analysts say, that may
account for why Feinstein is viewed in polls as the most popular
politician in California and Boxer is struggling in her re-election
fight against Republican state Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   A recent San Francisco Examiner poll showed for the first time
during the 1998 campaign that more voters viewed Boxer negatively
than positively _ usually a serious danger sign for an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed Fong taking a slight lead in the race. But
Boxer's numbers have always been low, she acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people I know who are Democrats basically dislike (Boxer)
intensely as an individual,'' said Laura Stoker, a political
scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``Certain
people engender very strong reactions. Bill Clinton is one, Barbara
Boxer is another. It's based on personality and impressions they
present to others.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to recent major votes, Feinstein and Boxer rarely
disagree. Of the 12 key votes in the 104th Congress (1994-'96)
tracked by the Almanac of American Politics, the senators differed
on only one: Boxer voted against allowing Congress and the states
to ban desecration of the American flag while Feinstein voted for
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein agreed on increasing the minimum wage,
prohibiting job discrimination against gays, keeping late-term
abortions legal, protecting the endangered-species list, and
extending funding for troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, dozens of votes over the past six years in
which Boxer and Feinstein were on opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, for example, voted against rewarding states with money
for reducing their out-of-wedlock birth rates without increasing
their abortion rates. Feinstein voted for the measure. Boxer voted
against increasing the number of generals in the Marine Corps;
Feinstein voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be little-noticed measures like these that account for
the view that Feinstein is more moderate than Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative public interest groups that rate lawmakers
consistently give Boxer their lowest marks, while granting
Feinstein some slack.
</P>
<P>
   These differences do not surprise the Boxer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be an expectation by some people that because
they are both women elected in the same year and they made history,
that they should abandon their views on the issues,'' said Boxer
campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski. ``I don't think they would be
doing their jobs as senators if they didn't look at each issue
seriously.''

   Perceived as a hard-core liberal, Boxer defeated conservative
Republican Bruce Herschensohn in 1992, the same year President
Clinton was swept into office. In her six years in the Senate,
analysts say, Boxer somehow hasn't been able to acquire the same
senatorial stature that Feinstein has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican political consultant in Los
Angeles, said Boxer appears to be a diligent senator but comes
``across as more of a rabble-rouser than a thoughtful senator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me she's a real hard worker, that she works on
California problems,'' Hoffenblum said. ``But when she comes before
the cameras, she's got a petition in her hand and she's seen as
showboating. That's hurt her badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Behr, a Boxer campaign adviser, said comparing Boxer's poll
numbers in the middle of the campaign to Feinstein's ratings is not
meaningful. Feinstein is not campaigning, Behr noted, and naturally
is viewed more positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you attach the word `candidate' to somebody, they
are seen in a different light,'' Behr said. He noted that when
former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth considered running for
U.S. Senate in 1992, his ratings dropped precipitously even though
he had done nothing but file candidacy papers.
</P>
<P>
   And Behr said there is as much of a style difference between
Boxer and Feinstein as ``there is between any two people. I think
there are some people who love her style and some people who
don't,'' he said of Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Feinstein has endorsed Boxer, and the two have
appeared a few times together on the campaign trail, mainly at
fund-raisers. They held a rally recently where Feinstein praised
Boxer for having ``backbone, courage and ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Feinstein told a news conference that she and Boxer
were ``a good team for California.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she ended, Feinstein directly addressed the issue of
comparisons, saying nobody talks about the differences between
Massachusetts Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, both
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we're different,'' Feinstein said. ``Just as two men
doing the same job would be different, two women doing the same job
would be different. You come from different perspectives. I was a
mayor, Barbara was a member of Congress. It is different in that
regard. That doesn't mean we can't be fast friends. That doesn't
mean we can't work together.''
