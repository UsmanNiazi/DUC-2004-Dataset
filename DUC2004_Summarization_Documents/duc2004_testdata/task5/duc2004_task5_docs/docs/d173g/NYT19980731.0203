GOP SENATE CANDIDATE GAINS ON INCUMBENT BARBARA BOXER

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ GOP candidate Matt Fong, who was written off as
unknown and too little funded to secure his party's nomination, is
whittling incumbent Barbara Boxer's once-healthy lead in
California's U.S. Senate race, a San Francisco Examiner poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Of those surveyed, Boxer won support from 43 percent compared
with 40 percent for state Treasurer Fong _ a statistical dead heat
based on the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In an Examiner poll taken in February, Boxer had a 9-point lead
over Fong. That had slipped to 5 points in a poll taken in May,
just before the June primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest poll, Boxer maintained strong support among women,
San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles voters and among independents,
the fastest-growing and most influential voting bloc in California.
With two men running for governor, Boxer is the most prominent
woman in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   She was first elected in 1992, after a brutal campaign against
Republican Bruce Herschensohn, and has long predicted her 1998
re-election campaign will be close.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Boxer faces a tougher campaign against Fong
than she would have against the man he beat in the primary,
car-alarm magnate Darrell Issa, a more conservative Republican with
a questionable past that included allegations he stole a car in his
youth and inflated his war record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxer is vulnerable,'' said Del Ali, senior vice president for
Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research of Columbia, Md., which
conducted the Examiner's poll. ``The one thing that makes this race
competitive is that Fong is a moderate enough Republican he could
knock her off. Boxer has never had good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 832 registered California voters was
conducted Sunday through Tuesday. All who participated said they
regularly vote in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer continues to have near-universal name recognition among
Californians, which means she can spend her time defining her image
and Senate voting record and not worry about introducing herself to
voters. Eight-seven percent of those surveyed recognized Fong's
name compared with 96 percent for Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   But a high percentage of voters _ 34 percent of those surveyed _
view Boxer negatively. Forty-one percent said they had a favorable
feeling about Boxer, compared with 35 percent for Fong. In
contrast, far more people said they were neutral about Fong than
they were about Boxer, meaning Fong has more work to do to solidify
support.
</P>
<P>
   To win re-election, some analysts say, Boxer must attack Fong to
increase the number of people who view him negatively _ now only 9
percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they think the campaign could get nasty, like the 1994
race between Sen. Dianne Feinstein and millionaire Michael
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petracca, a political scientist at the University of
California at Irvine, said that ``Boxer may have to do to Fong what
Huffington did to Feinstein. He turned somebody who was extremely
popular into somebody with very high negatives as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali said he's never seen a poll showing Boxer with more than 50
percent support of those surveyed. With a number of third-party
candidates on the ballot, the winner could easily tally less than
50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign aides point out that only one of the past five
U.S. Senate races was won by a candidate who received more than 50
percent of the vote. That was in 1992, when Democrat Feinstein
trounced Republican John Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, like GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren, opposes
state-funded abortions, says minors should be required to get
parental consent for an abortion and is opposed to late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republican women who support abortion rights could
swing toward Boxer on this issue alone, some analysts said.
