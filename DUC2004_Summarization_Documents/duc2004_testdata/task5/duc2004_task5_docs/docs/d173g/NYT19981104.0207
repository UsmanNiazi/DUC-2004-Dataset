   SAN FRANCISCO _ Women and minorities turned out in huge numbers
Tuesday to support Sen. Barbara Boxer, giving the Democrat a
re-election victory with a surprisingly comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   The race, expected to be an election-night cliffhanger, became a
runaway for Boxer. Fueled by a multimillion-dollar barrage of
mostly negative campaign advertising, Boxer outpolled Republican
state Treasurer Matt Fong by 53 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed by her opponent and some analysts as too liberal for
California, Boxer won with strong support from voters in the San
Francisco area and Los Angeles. But the first-term senator also
polled nearly evenly with Fong in the Central Valley and Southern
California suburbs, where pre-election polls had shown Fong with an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we couldn't do it, that I was a fluke of history,''
Boxer told a packed crowd of supporters and rowdy campaign workers
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that I was too progressive. They said that I was too
supportive of the president. They said I was too feisty. ... They
all missed something. They missed the deep support that I have in
every part of this beautiful state because we stand together on the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who has called it the race of her life, savored the
victory, clapping to the beat of James Brown's ``I Feel Good''
along with her husband, Stewart, an Oakland lawyer, and adult
children, Doug and Nicole. She also was joined onstage by Reps.
Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee and state Sen. John Burton, who
cajoled her into running for Congress in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was decidedly different in Newport Beach, where a
teary-eyed Fong spoke to the small crowd that remained after a
series of concession speeches by Lungren and other Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Democrats and Republicans. Tonight, after the
elections, we are Californians and Americans,'' Fong said, with his
wife Paula and teen-age children, Matthew and Jade, at his side.
``I wish them well, but tomorrow in America is another day, so
watch out. We're coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's margin of victory was a surprise to some supporters and
a blow to Republican strategists, who had seen her as vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But she overwhelmingly won the support of women voters,
exploiting a gender gap that Democrats have ridden to election
victories in recent years. And, as part of her coalition of women
and minorities, Boxer took 55 percent of Asian-Americans, who were
expected to vote heavily for Fong, a fourth-generation
Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election came down, once again, to a focus on issues that
tend to matter most to women and minorities _ education in
particular, but also gun control and choice and social issues in
general,'' said Mark Baldassare, pollster with the nonpartisan
Public Policy Institute of California. ``Women voters came back to
Barbara Boxer ... but I think (she) also benefited from a strong
vote among African-Americans, Latinos and Asian-Americans, which
Democrats generally enjoyed in this election.''

   Tuesday's election marked a reversal of fortunes in a campaign
that began with Boxer on the defensive over her links to a troubled
President Clinton and ended with Fong railing against what he
called ``nasty, distorted'' attack ads from his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Fong looked like a serious contender after pulling off a
come-from-behind victory in the June primary against San Diego
car-alarm magnate Darrell Issa, who outspent him 4-1. He was lifted
by a surge of crossover Democrats, including many Asian-Americans,
who saw him as moderate and knew him from his mother, March Fong
Eu, the longtime secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign struggled through the summer as Fong toured the
state and raised money while she was stuck in Washington. But when
Congress wrapped up its business last month, she returned to
California and began campaigning nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   It was in August that Clinton admitted an affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Boxer, whose daughter is
married to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, immediately
was singled out. Critics howled that she was a hypocrite for
avoiding a hard line against Clinton after being an outspoken
critic of other public figures accused of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   At an Aug. 26 debate in Hollywood, Fong charged that her silence
on the Clinton affair was ``deafening.'' Two weeks later, she
condemned the president's behavior as immoral and the polls showed
the race tightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating to have the month dominated by Monica
Lewinsky,'' Boxer campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said of the
White House intern with whom Clinton carried on an extramarital
affair. ``We really couldn't get traction on the issues we wanted
to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the affair undermined Fong's efforts to create a
strong impression with voters. His speeches on water policy and
national security were mostly ignored, while his comments about
Boxer and her ties to Clinton got front-page play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Matt Fong's candidacy never got off the ground,
really,'' said Rollin Post, a veteran television commentator in San
Francisco. ``First of all, no one really knew who he was. He never
really made a really positive case for himself. His campaign seemed
to be assuming that Boxer was unpopular enough so that you could
win by being the alternative.''
