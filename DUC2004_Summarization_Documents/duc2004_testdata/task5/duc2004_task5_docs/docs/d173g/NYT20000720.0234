   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer announced
Thursday they will wield gavels during the 2000 Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles next month as the first two women
co-chairs of a national political convention.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Boxer, both California Democrats, will make
opening remarks at the convention, which begins Aug. 14th and
preside over votes and official business from the dais.
</P>
<P>
   The two women previously chaired Democratic conventions as
single chairpersons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Democrats chose Texas Gov. Ann Richards to chair their
New York convention and in 1984, Gov. Martha Layne Collins of
Kentucky was selected as the chair of the convention held in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the convention would shine a spotlight on the
fact that California _ the largest state in the country with 34
million people _ has elected two women senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the openness of the party to women,'' Feinstein
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer recalled watching Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., on the
dais at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York when
she nominated Al Gore as vice president. At the time Mikulski was
the only Democratic woman senator who hadn't been appointed to fill
a position.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate now has nine women: Feinstein, Boxer, Mikulski and
Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, Patty Murray, D-Wash, and Sens. Olympia Snowe
and Susan Collins, both Maine Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein were both running for Senate seats in 1992
and both spoke at the convention that year. ``It was an amazing
experience,'' Boxer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining
two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to
become governor. Boxer also won her election, succeeding the
retiring Alan Cranston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've made history together as the first women co-chairs
of the convention, so this is a wonderful moment,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee also announced Thursday that
California Gov. Gray Davis will serve as the convention's honorary
chair.
