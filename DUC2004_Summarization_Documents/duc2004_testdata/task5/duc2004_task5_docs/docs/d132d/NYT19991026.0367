NEW YORK: this year .   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal law requires retired government officials to refrain
from interceding with their former agency on behalf of a new
employer for at least one year after leaving public service. The
Clinton administration requires its top officials to pledge that
they will not lobby their agency for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that he would take a ``belt and suspenders'' approach
to ethics questions, regularly consulting with a lawyer, if
necessary, to make sure that his work for the company did not raise
questions about influence peddling or conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be any political sensitivity
here,'' Rubin said. ``I am involved in the business of this
organization, not in lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged that he had helped to broker a deal to make
possible the compromise agreement repealing Glass-Steagall even
during his negotiations with Citigroup. He said he had a hand in
urging Congress and the White House to preserve the Community
Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to channel a portion of
their lending to poor, inner city areas. The future of that act had
been a sticking point between Republicans and the White House that
held up agreement on the financial overhaul package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care greatly about CRA,'' Rubin said, adding that he was
pleased with the final legislative compromise. ``I did have
conversations about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Weill said that they had come to know one another
while Rubin was in office and Weill was constructing Citigroup, the
formation of which involved required extensive talks with
government regulators. Weill was also perhaps Wall Street's most
active lobbyist on behalf of the financial services overhaul, in
which Rubin played a guiding role. Though both men are avid
Democrats and have spent their careers in New York financial
circles, they said they had not been close friends before.
</P>
<P>
   But both Rubin and Weill said that they had not discussed
Rubin's future when Rubin was at the treasury department. Citigroup
officials said that Weill first raised the offer of a job at the
company in mid-September, more than two months after Rubin resigned
his post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have inappropriate to discuss that while I was in
office,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, Weill and Reed all said that Rubin's role at the firm
would go far beyond cajoling corporate executives and government
officials to hire Citigroup bankers, however. He intends to help
plot the firm's strategy. He and the two Citigroup executives said
they would be walking in and out of each other's offices all day,
running the firm as a troika.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offices are adjacent and no one will be out of touch,''
said Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup officials declined to discuss Rubin's compensation
package, although details will have to be revealed in a proxy
statement next spring because Rubin will be a director of the
company and will likely be one of its most highly paid executives.
Asked about his pay, Rubin declined to comment. But asked if it
would top his $150,000 salary as treasury secretary, he deadpanned:
``That's a fair assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not need the money. When he entered government service
in early 1993, Rubin put his assets, most of which consisted of
partnership shares in Goldman, into a blind trust. The trust at the
time was valued at about $100 million, though it has possibly
increased considerably in value given the bull market in stocks
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by leaving Goldman and accepting cash in exchange for his
shares, Rubin missed the windfall other partners enjoyed when
Goldman became a public company earlier this year. Had he remained
the top executive at Goldman, his assets would have increased at
least three fold in value and totaled over half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his old Goldman pay pales in comparison with what
Weill and Reed now earn at Citigroup. Last year, Weill and Reed had
total compensation, including stock options, valued at about $27
million. Rubin seems unlikely to earn as much as either Weill or
Reed because he does not have the same executive responsibilities.
But his senior role in the firm suggests that he could easily earn
tens of millions of dollars in salary, bonus and stock options each
year.
