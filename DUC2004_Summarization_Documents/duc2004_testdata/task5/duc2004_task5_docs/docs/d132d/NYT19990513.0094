</P>
<P>
   Americans -- at least those who own stock -- have not only
endorsed the infallibility of the markets, they have also endorsed
the infallibility of the people who watch over those markets.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was long ago elevated to
divinity.
</P>
<P>
   And Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who announced his
resignation Wednesday, has joined Greenspan in the pantheon of
Money Gods. (There are no atheists in bull markets.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, but especially since rumors of his
departure began circulating this spring, Rubin has been bathing in
media slobber. He has been credited with eliminating the deficit,
captaining the U.S. economy through seven fat years, vanquishing
the Asian financial crisis, transmuting base metals into golds, and
generally doing eight impossible things before breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Does Rubin deserve this sanctification? Is there, in fact,
ANYTHING wrong with Bob?
</P>
<P>
   As with Greenspan, Rubin's godliness rests on a foundation of
genuine accomplishment. In 1993, Rubin was one of several Clinton
advisers who urged deficit reduction rather than economic stimulus.
This tightfistedness set the table for the current boom, leading to
low interest rates, job growth, the Wall Street explosion, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rubin's cautious advice has helped ensure that the
administration did nothing to screw up the prosperity. Rubin
lobbied for NAFTA and GATT.
</P>
<P>
   His friendly relations with Greenspan -- a dramatic contrast to
the Bush administration's squabbling with the Fed -- has soothed
bankers and investors. His deft manipulation of the debt ceiling
during the 1995-96 government shutdown prevented a U.S. default and
guaranteed that the political war between the president and the
Republican Congress would not derail the thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   And as a conservative Wall Street veteran in a White House of
Democratic political operatives, Rubin brought market credibility
to the Clinton administration, reassuring the New York money folks
that Washington would not go loopy on them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling evidence of Rubin's accomplishment
may be, perversely, Wall Street's yawn at his resignation. The Dow
dropped more than 200 points on the news, then gained most of it
back within the hour. This is testament to Wall Street's faith that
Rubin has been so successful that the White House won't dare change
his pro-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's deification is not simply the result of having done
a good job. Who HASN'T done a good job during the past few years?
</P>
<P>
   His reputation depends on style as much as substance. In a
Republican administration, Rubin would be another gray suit,
another dull rich guy moonlighting as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin has been blessed with a boss and colleagues who make
him look good by comparison. Clinton is emotional, loud, chaotic,
horny, and enveloped by Monica sleaze. Rubin is ascetic,
controlled, rational, quiet, and untouched by any of the zillion
Clinton scandals. During Flytrap and since, Rubin's chilliness has
been a welcome adult relief from the childish president.
</P>
<P>
   In a more democratic Democratic administration, Rubin's wealth
-- estimated at $125 million or more -- would have made him
suspect. But among the Clintonians, it has burnished him. He seems
the Cincinnatus of Washington: Unlike the political types around
him, he has proved himself in another arena.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need the power and prestige of Washington and feels
no compulsion to claw his way up. This is rare among D.C. pols.
Having been assigned the role of the Amateur Politician, Rubin
seems pure next to the sleazy pros. (He is not, of course, an
amateur.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's work on Social Security reform has demonstrated his
comfort with the everyday politics of compromise and spin. Rubin is
skeptical about government investment of Social Security funds in
private markets and fought it during the administration's internal
debates. The president's plan endorses massive government
investment in Wall Street. Rubin, a loyal soldier, has emerged as
one of the administration's top spokesmen for the plan and doesn't
talk about his objections to it.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has another rare quality. He does not seek press coverage,
and when he is covered, he speaks with blandness in order not to
make news.
</P>
<P>
   This silence impresses those who cover him: Compare the media's
worshipful treatment of Rubin with its scorn of publicity-seekers
such as Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo or Treasury
Secretary-designate Larry Summers, Rubin's longtime deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's reticence, as well as his praise of underlings and
colleagues, has earned him an enormous, though not fully deserved,
reputation for humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This humility stuff is nonsense,'' says a former White House
colleague of Rubin's. ``He does not need to elbow others out of the
way and brag, but it's not because he's humble. It's because he is
totally confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin subtly enhances his own reputation for perfection by
talking frequently about his imperfections. In interviews, he
repeatedly emphasizes the uncertainty of his job. He describes to
reporters how he focuses on weighing and reweighing percentages
until he makes the best possible decision in ambiguous
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fine way to make decisions, as Rubin has proved, but
it is an equally good way to protect your image. If a decision
turns out well, it's because you calculated it would. If it turns
out badly, it's not your fault: You made the most rational choice
you could.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin agnostics will be glad to learn that there are two weak
spots in his record. He arrived in Washington as a supposed
champion of the poor. He was expected to use his position as head
of the National Economic Council and later as treasury secretary to
redirect federal resources toward inner cities and the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's cautiousness has got the better of him. Although he
strongly disagreed with the welfare reform bill, he didn't battle
hard to prevent Clinton from signing it. And instead of lobbying
for large-scale anti-poverty or urban revival programs, Rubin
settled for mini-government: small efforts to prod banks to extend
credit in troubled neighborhoods, micro-loan programs to encourage
entrepreneurship among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Rubin's defense, his stewardship of the economy has done more
to help the poor than any federal grant program could have.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary has also been excessively obeisant to Wall Street.
Though Rubin has bucked Wall Street by opposing a capital-gains tax
cut, he comes from Wall Street, and most of his closest friends and
advisers are Wall Streeters, and he generally heeds the street.
</P>
<P>
   During the global financial crisis, Rubin has halfheartedly
warned Americans not to invest cavalierly in weak foreign
economies, but anytime foolhardy American investors have been
threatened, Rubin has rushed to save them. During the Asia, Russia,
and Brazil crises, Rubin constructed bailout deals that benefited
outside creditors above all.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was not trying to help Wall Street. According to
Rubin's logic, safeguarding investors in these troubled economies
prevents contagion from spreading. If American investors thought
they were going to lose the billions they had unwisely put in
Korea, they might pull out of Latin America, Eastern Europe, or the
rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists, especially non-Americans, complain that
Rubin has been far too obliging toward his old colleagues and
indifferent to the poor Russians and bankrupted Koreans damaged by
his decisions. (After all, when Wall Streeters say today that the
Asia crisis is ``over,'' what they mean is that American exposure
is over. The economies of Asia are still a mess.)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's relief for Americans has encouraged a moral hazard -- an
inducement for people to speculate excessively because they know
the United States will rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory capture of Rubin by Wall Street has not only
benefited Wall Street, it has also polished Rubin's reputation.
When Rubin makes decisions that aid Wall Street, analysts and
traders reciprocate in the financial media, telling CNBC, The Wall
Street Journal, Bloomberg, et al., just how wise the good secretary
is.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin himself probably does not care about such back scratching,
but it is a lesson that heir-apparent Summers, an eager press
hound, has surely absorbed. Be nice to Wall Street, and perhaps you
can be a money god, too.
