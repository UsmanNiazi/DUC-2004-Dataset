Rubin urges Kenya to combat corruption, spur growth
</HEADLINE>

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
Friday urged Kenya to combat corruption and get its economy back on
track.
	   In an address to the Kenyan School For Monetary Studies, Rubin
said Kenya's reforms have slowed along with its economy.
	   ``The challenge for Kenya is to get back on track toward strong
growth and higher standards of living for its people,'' Rubin said.
	   To attract foreign investment, he said developing countries need
sound macroeconomic policies, a strong financial system, open
markets and good governments.
	   Corruption, which Rubin said could not be discussed until
recently, is ``very much an economic issue,'' he added.
	   ``Corruption exists everywhere, but corruption is especially
troubling in developing countries'' where it diverts scarce
resources, Rubin noted. ``In short, corruption benefits the few and
hurts the many.''
	   Foreign investors are deterred from countries with high levels
of corruption, he added.
	   Kenya had success previously in attracting foreign capital,
producing growth of nearly 5 percent in 1995. Rubin said that
should have allowed the country to work toward even higher growth
``but instead, Kenya is now going in the opposite direction.
Foreign direct investment has declined and growth has slowed.''
	   Earlier this week the Central Bank of Kenya put the current
growth rate at around 1.9 percent.
	   To combat corruption and and attract investment, Rubin said
developing countries need clear laws and regulations that are
fairly and easily enforced, honest, well trained regulators and
judges, and anti-corruption units with real power to crack down on
corrupt practices.
	   Privatizing state-owned enterprises also reduces opportunities
for corruption, Rubin said, noting that corruption has declined
significantly in former Communist countries that have privatized
businesses previously run by the government.
	   Well-regulated financial systems where credit isn't allocated
based on connections and efficient public service also are
essential in Rubin's view.
	   While none of that is easy, Rubin said developing countries of
Africa can't turn away from the struggle, saying ``the politics of
reform must keep pace with the policies of reform.''
	   Rubin's remarks followed his meeting with Kenyan President Moi.
He was scheduled to meet with East African central bankers and
finance ministers later Friday before concluding his week-long
African trip that also included stops in Ivory Coast, South Africa,
Namibia and Mozambique.
