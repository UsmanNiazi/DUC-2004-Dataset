RUBIN LIKELY TO MISS BIG WINDFALL FROM OLD FIRM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Rubin, before joining the Clinton
administration, built his career at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., trading
stakes in companies as head of that Wall Street firm's arbitrage
desk.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as something of a surprise that Rubin, now treasury
secretary, may have missed out on what would probably have created
the biggest windfall of his life: the planned sale this autumn of a
slice of Goldman, Sachs, which is expected to put a value of about
$28 billion on Wall Street's last big investment banking
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Until he left in late 1992 to join the government, Rubin held
one of the very largest ownership stakes in Goldman, where he
worked for 26 years. Just at book value, Rubin's stake was worth an
estimated $100 million in 1992. Allowing for the healthy
appreciation he would have enjoyed then, and the opportunity this
fall to sell his stake at as much as three times book value, Rubin
may have left the better part of half a billion dollars on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   It might even have been as much as $1.5 billion. Rubin and
Stephen Friedman, co-heads of Goldman from 1990 to 1992, had the
biggest stakes in the Goldman partnership in the early 1990's, when
the firm's top officers still could hold as much as 5 percent of
the partnership, according to people at Goldman. (Since those days,
the leaders' stakes have been whittled down some by the need to
spread ownership more widely in the firm.) Still, a 5 percent stake
in a partnership that is expected to be valued at $28 billion,
would have brought $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Smith, a Treasury Department spokeswoman, said on
Monday that Rubin would not comment in reply to questions about his
missing out on the Goldman sale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the decision by Rubin to quit Goldman has brought
other rewards, and friends say he is very wealthy from his many
years on Wall Street. Joining the Clinton White House in January
1993, Rubin was appointed treasury secretary in December 1994. At
the Treasury Department, Rubin has won bipartisan plaudits for his
handling of the reduction of the budget deficit and for many of the
other difficult economic issues he has touched. Even so, some of
Rubin's charisma has derived from his enviable status as one of the
capital's richest men, thanks to his years at Goldman. As Treasury
Secretary, Rubin is paid an annual salary of $99,500.
</P>
<P>
   But some who have toiled in government will actually benefit
from the planned Goldman sale. The road that Rubin traveled from
Goldman to government is a two-way street. Such senior government
officials as Gerald Corrigan, former president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York; Peter Sutherland, former commissioner of
the European Community and former head of the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs, and Thomas Healey, the assistant secretary for
domestic finance at the Treasury Department in the first Reagan
administration, have all left government in recent years to join
Goldman and become partners.
</P>
<P>
   Former partners of Goldman generally ``go limited,'' meaning
they become limited partners and maintain a stake in the firm that
is paid out over several years. They also earn some interest on
their stake during those years.
</P>
<P>
   But because of concerns about potential conflicts of interest
with his role in government, Rubin resigned his partnership and
sold it back to Goldman before joining the administration as
chairman of National Economic Council in January 1993. Even though
Rubin is being paid out by Goldman over several years, he cannot
benefit from Goldman's successes under the agreement he struck with
his former firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said Rubin ``has no economic stake in Goldman's
success or failure.'' Unlike Friedman and other limited partners,
he is not listed in the firm's directory. The money that Goldman
pays to Rubin goes into a blind trust that holds the rest of his
investments, she added.
