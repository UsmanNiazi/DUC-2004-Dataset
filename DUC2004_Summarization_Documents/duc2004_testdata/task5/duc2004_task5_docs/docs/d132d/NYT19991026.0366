   NEW YORK _ Robert E. Rubin, arguably the best known financier of
his generation and the recently retired treasury secretary, has
taken a top position at Citigroup, the nation's largest financial
services company.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, 61 and the former top official of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.,
said Tuesday he had joined Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the
co-heads of Citigroup, in what Reed described as a ``three-person
office of the chairman'' overseeing what has become the first true
American financial conglomerate since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes less than a week after the Clinton
administration and Congress agreed on a compromise bill that would
overhaul the laws that regulate the financial industry, a measure
that removes many of the restrictions preventing banks, securities
firms and insurance companies from buying one another other or
engaging in one another's businesses. Both Rubin and Citigroup
strongly supported the bill. But Rubin said the likely repeal of
the so-called Glass-Steagall legislation had nothing to do with his
decision to join the company.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment settles the swirl of speculation about what
Rubin, who is considered a hero by some for engineering one of
America's longest economic booms, would do for an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also discussed employment with American International
Group, a leading life insurance company, and Warburg Pincus, a New
York investment firm, before agreeing to join Citigroup, said
people who were told about Rubin's negotiations. He also had
discussions with Goldman about serving on his old firm's board of
directors, people close to Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin declined to discuss his talks with any other company, and
officials of those three companies also declined to comment.
Citigroup officials said that while Rubin would be free to pursue
outside endeavors, including a role in local New York or national
politics, he would not work for any financial company that competes
with Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin will not become a third chief executive with Weill and
Reed, who brought Citigroup together by joining Citibank, one of
America's leading banks, with Traveler's Group, a large insurance
company and investment bank last year and have had a sometimes
rocky relationship since then. Rubin will head the executive
committee of Citigroup's board, work full time at the company, and
participate in all major managerial and strategic decisions, the
three men said. Rubin will also have a corner office alongside
Weill and Reed in the company's blond-wood and glass executive
suite in mid-town Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the issues of managing a large institution and I
want to really get back involved,'' Rubin said in an interview.
``I'd also like to fish, read books and play tennis, but life is a
trade off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's role at Citigroup appears to be a delicate balance
between his desire to take an active role in plotting the future of
the company , but to avoid becoming a chief executive or to have
day-to-day responsibilities for a particular part of the business.
The terms of his employment were complex enough that it took five
weeks of almost constant meetings to negotiate, people close to
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   No Citigroup employees will report to him directly. But Rubin
plans to bring Michael Froman, his former Treasury Department chief
of staff, to work at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has the best job in the company: no line responsibility,
but he will be a full partner,'' Reed said during a meeting to
announce Rubin's appointment at Citigroup's Park Avenue
headquarters here on Park Avenue. ``He will not play a role as an
executive officer of the company, as Sandy and I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   But after years as the government's top economic official, Rubin
brings to Citigroup a rolodex of contacts that one bank analyst
called priceless. To the extent that he is willing to use his
contacts to push Citigroup's banking business around the world,
Rubin could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also saw the Rubin name on Citigroup's marquee as
a draw for star bankers on Wall Street, potentially making the
firm's Salmon Smith Barney investment bank a more formidable
competitor to other firms, including Goldman, where Rubin spent the
bulk of his career as a bond trader and senior executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be one of the most well regarded individuals among
senior government officials and corporations world wide. He can get
a meeting with anyone he wants,'' said Joan Solotar, who analyzes
Citigroup for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``They will win deals
that they would not otherwise have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's return to Wall Street is not unprecedented. James Baker,
the former Bush and Reagan administration official, joined Carlyle
Group, a venture capital and buy-out firm. Nicholas Brady, a Bush
administration treasury secretary, also followed Rubin's circular
path from Wall Street to Washington and back. Brady now heads Darby
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, however, cuts a much higher profile. It has 100
million clients in 100 countries and is on course this year to earn
$10 billion in net profits, far ahead of any of its rivals in the
finance industry. It was also one of the leading forces in
Washington pushing for an overhaul of financial laws, in part
because Citigroup might have had to sell some of its businesses,
including its insurance underwriting subsidiary, if Congress had
not agreed to pass reforms this year.
