	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
stressed Tuesday that the risk of the Asian crisis turning into a
global depression remains low, but the most likely trigger would be
the perilous state of Japan's economy.
	   Rubin told reporters that a recalcitrant U.S. Congress needs to
approve dlrs 18 billion for the International Monetary Fund sought
by the Clinton administration so it can quickly respond to new
outbreaks of economic upheaval.
	   Otherwise, a new phase of the crisis ``could result in a very
substantive impact on the American economy,'' until now largely
spared except for agricultural exports, Rubin said.
	   Rubin stopped in Thailand after China and Malaysia on a
pulse-taking trip a year after the crisis erupted July 2, 1997,
when Thailand allowed the baht to depreciate, touching off an
epidemic of currency turmoil. He left Tuesday afternoon for his
final stop, South Korea.
	   Rubin repeated his message that Japan's failure to reverse
economic stagnation since the bubble economy collapsed eight years
ago was delaying regional recovery and posed the chief threat of
the crisis spreading outside Asia.
	   ``I think the probability of global contagion is always low,''
Rubin said. ``What Japan does is very important. The immediate
focus on Japan is to develop effective responses in their banking
sector that win respect in international markets.''
	   Rubin said earlier in an address to business students at
Chulalongkorn University that Japan needed to create an economy
``led by domestic demand and a healthy currency.''
	   ``It is critical to the economic health of Thailand, the region
and the rest of the world,'' Rubin said.
	   The Japanese yen was recently propped up by U.S. intervention,
and Rubin did not rule out such action again if ``appropriate.'' It
was the first sale of dollars by Washington in financial markets
since 1992.
	   The United States has stressed that Japan needs to implement a
range of structural economic reforms and particularly deal with bad
loans troubling its banking sector.
	   Rubin met Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and said the United States stands ready to
back additional demands for credit by Thailand from the IMF, but
neither he nor Tarrin indicated that would be required.
	   The Thai government has shut down 56 finance companies and taken
over four small banks to sort out its financial sector. Rubin said
he had reviewed banking sector reforms with Thai officials but
refused to disclose details.
	   Rubin responded to a student's question about whether banks
should be nationalized by saying it was up to Thai authorities.
	   Rubin defended the IMF, which is leading bailouts totaling some
dlrs 120 billion for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, for
demanding tight monetary policies that critics say are making the
crisis worse by killing businesses.
	   Lowering interest rates would only divert attention from the
real reforms that need to be made and delay ``getting back to solid
growth and financial stability,'' Rubin said.
	   Asia's recovery will be rooted in values he said had created
growth in the first place: a strong work ethic, high savings rate
and focus on education. But he gave no time-frame for recovery.
	   Rubin said that financial speculators, blamed by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad for causing the crisis, were only minor
culprits.
	   The main causes were capital flight because of fear over poor
policies and corporations shielding against unstable domestic
currencies by buying dollars, Rubin said.
