   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 13:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin's decision to step aside as Treasury Secretary was
responsibly timed in that the major crises in the world now are not
primarily economic. Nonetheless, he will be missed, in part because
he anchored a changing cast of Cabinet and White House officials.
The U.S. economy _ and those of many other countries _ might be in
far worse shape had not his expertise and calm determination helped
steer the Clinton administration's economic policies for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin deserves a significant part of the credit for putting the
government on a course to balance the federal budget, and he will
be remembered as perhaps the most influential member of the Cabinet
at a time that economic issues came to rival security concerns in
determining U.S. relations with other countries. He can also take
pride that it has been more than eight years since the last U.S.
recession ended.
</P>
<P>
   The understanding of markets that Rubin gained in a career as a
bond trader proved to be invaluable in a world coming to grips with
the growing reach of markets and the billions of dollars in capital
that can be moved from one market to another by traders interested
more in quick profits than long-term development.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, a former co-chairman of the investment bank Goldman,
Sachs, was chairman of President Clinton's National Economic
Council until he was chosen as Treasury secretary in late 1994,
shortly before the Mexican crisis erupted as that country's
currency fell sharply. It was Rubin who put together a rescue
package that enabled Mexico to come through the crisis and also
kept that crisis from infecting the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The bad part of the rescue _ that investors who had unwisely
lent money to Mexico emerged unscathed _ came back to haunt the
world by encouraging investors to make ill-considered investments
in other countries. That contributed to the Asian crisis that
erupted in 1997, but investors who thought such lending was
risk-free learned otherwise when no bailout materialized after
Russia defaulted on its debts last summer.
</P>
<P>
   While there was criticism of the way the International Monetary
Fund, with Rubin's approval, handled the Asian crisis by forcing
countries to raise interest rates and bring on recessions, the fact
is that most of Asia is on the mend and those policies now appear
to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary named to succeed Rubin,
is an outstanding if sometimes undiplomatic economist who is well
qualified and deserves prompt confirmation.
