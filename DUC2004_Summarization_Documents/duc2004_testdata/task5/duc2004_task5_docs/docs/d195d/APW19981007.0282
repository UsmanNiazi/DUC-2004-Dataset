	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright convened three-way talks Wednesday with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders in hopes of moving closer to a
long-sought West Bank accord.
	   Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Albright faced dozens of
hurdles in her second day of Mideast peacemaking with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The three had a three-way handshake as they posed for
photographs at the start of the low-expectation meeting. Albright,
Netanyahu and Arafat sat around a square table so small their knees
and elbows were almost touching.
	   Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.
	   At one point during the meeting, Albright got up and walked out
of the room, leaving Netanyahu and Arafat to talk alone. It was the
first time in a year the two leaders spoke without mediators.
	   Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while Albright
is in the region. But she hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most
particularly security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in
advance of a White House summit later in the month.
	   At this border, 6th graf pvs.
