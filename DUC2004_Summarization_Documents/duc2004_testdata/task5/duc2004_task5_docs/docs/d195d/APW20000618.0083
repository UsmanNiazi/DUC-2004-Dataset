   BOSTON (AP) -- America must play a leading role to protect the
rights of women and workers around the world, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright told graduates at Northeastern University.

   Addressing the school's 98th commencement Saturday, Albright
said she was proud of American foreign policy accomplishments in
the Middle East, the Korean peninsula and Northern Ireland. But she
said more can be done.

<P>
   Albright focused on suffering endured by women, including
domestic violence, mutilation and killings over dowry disputes.

   ''Some say this is all cultural and there's nothing we can do
about it. I say it's criminal and we each have an obligation to
stop it,'' Albright told the 1,800 graduates.

<P>
   In recalling her experience as secretary of state, Albright said
she will most remember not heads of state but people victimized by
violence and suffering.

   ''I have been called the world's most powerful woman, but when a
mother dying of AIDS in Africa asked me to be sure her children
were cared for -- I lacked even the power of speech, because I did
not know what I could honestly say,'' Albright said.
