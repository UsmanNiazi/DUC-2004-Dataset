	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Democracy and free-market economic
reforms have helped reduce rural poverty and improve the lives of
women in Latin America, but major problems persist, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
	   ``Despite the progress, huge challenges of underdevelopment
remain,'' Albright told the Organization of American States. The
benefits of open societies and open markets must be delivered to
``not just some, but all of our people.''
	   The three-day OAS meeting, which ends Wednesday, has addressed
subjects including corruption, drug trafficking, poverty and
consolidating democracy.
	   Albright also said Tuesday that an undercover money-laundering
sting operation in Mexico, dubbed ``Operation Casablanca'', had
suffered from a lack of coordination.
	   Some 160 Mexicans were charged in the operation by U.S.
authorities in the one of the largest money-laundering probes in
history. Five Venezuelan bankers also were indicted.
	   Mexico's foreign secretary, Rosario Green, earlier criticized
the United States for not keeping Mexican authorities informed of
the three-year operation. Albright and Green met Monday night to
discuss the tensions.
	   ``Obviously there needs to be better coordination in terms of
our joint efforts dealing with money laundering and
narcotrafficking,'' Albright said at a news conference.
	   Albright also rejected suggestions by some countries that Cuba
be readmitted to the OAS. It was thrown out in 1962 after the
United States accused Cuba President Fidel Castro of supporting
leftist rebels in the region.
	   Addressing foreign ministers from 34 countries, Albright said
children are staying in school longer, women are gaining more
access to education and health care, and 1 million people are to
receive loans for micro-enterprises in the next few years.
	   Still, overall poverty in the region has gone up since 1980,
with a record 210 million people now below the poverty line,
according to the OAS.
	   Latin America suffers the greatest gap between poor and rich in
the world; in some countries, 10 percent of the population controls
50 percent or more of the wealth, the OAS says.
	   Albright's visit to Caracas was to end Tuesday when she departs
for Washington, then to Geneva for talks on nuclear testing in
India and Pakistan. She urged OAS delegates to strongly condemn the
testing.
