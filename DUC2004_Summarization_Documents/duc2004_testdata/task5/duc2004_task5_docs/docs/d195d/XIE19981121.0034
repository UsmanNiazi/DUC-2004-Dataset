<HEADLINE> Albright Says Yugoslavia Increasing Police in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia is increasing
rather than decreasing special police forces in Kosovo province,
thus violating a U.S.-brokered agreement, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference with NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana, Albright also stepped up pressure on ethnic
Albanian separatist guerrillas in Kosovo to cease attacks on Serb
forces there.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that a humanitarian catastrophe has been averted
in Kosovo after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
threated to use force against Yugoslavia last month.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, both sides continue to commit acts that violate
the cease-fire and harm the prospects for peace," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) refrain from
reprisals and efforts to intimidate, but its provocations do not
justify failures by the Serb government to meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright complained that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is violating ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic is increasing, rather than decreasing, the
number of special police in Kosovo. And he is failing to ensure
proper police behavior," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
She warned that Serb actions are being monitored and that NATO
will insist on compliance.
</P>
<P>
The secretary called on both sides to "work to improve the
climate for an interim political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Albright also stressed the importance of NATO in European
security structure. Many believe that NATO, an outcome of the
Cold War, should have gone away with the break-up of the former
Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Both Albright and Solana agreed that the indispensable function
played by NATO in Bosnia and now in Kosovo is "evidence of the
alliance's continued role as the foundation of European security,"
said Albright.
</P>
<P>
The two also focused on plans for next month's NATO ministerial
in Brussels and the April summit in Washington, where the alliance
will chart a course for the alliance's second 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"we discussed the need to convey to the public more effectively
NATO's purpose and role in the new century," said Albright.
