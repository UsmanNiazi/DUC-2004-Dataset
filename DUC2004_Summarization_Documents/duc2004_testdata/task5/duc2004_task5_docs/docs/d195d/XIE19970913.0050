<P>
DAMASCUS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright left here this evening after a lightening
visit, on the fourth leg of her Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad received and had four-hour
talks with the visiting U.S. top diplomat on the latest
developments in the region particularly the possibility of
resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
No details of the talks are available as both sides remain
tight-lipped about the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Attending at the Assad-Albright meeting which was held right
upon the arrival of Albright, were Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Shara, Syrian Ambassador to the United States Walid Al-Muallem,
the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East peace process Dennis
Ross and the U.S. Ambassador to Syria Christopher Ross.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to Syria was aimed as seeking an opportunity for
resuming the Syrian-Israel peace process since Damascus voiced
satisfaction at the remarks made by Albright on August 6 in the
U.S. Press Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Albright had said the land-for-peace principle and the two
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 are the basis of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official daily "Al-Thawrah" expressed hope today
that Albright's visit would yield positive results and make a
breakthrough for the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright left here for Alexandria, Egypt, where she will brief
the Egyptian leaders of her visit to Israel, Palestinian self-rule
areas and Syria. She is scheduled to visit Jordan and Saudi Arabia
after her short stay in Egypt.
