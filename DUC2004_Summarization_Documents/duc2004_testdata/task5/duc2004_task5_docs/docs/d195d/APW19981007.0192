	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a last attempt to narrow
the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held talks Wednesday with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials said Albright has made little
progress during her two-day visit. Albright hopes to prepare the
ground for a Mideast summit in Washington in mid-October.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Albright briefed Israeli President Ezer
Weizman over breakfast. Weizman said he was ``a bit more
optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
	   Weizman said he heard nothing concrete in Albright's report, but
expected the negotiations to continue. He said reaching an
agreement depends on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu.
	   ``I think this must be done,'' he said, ``But the prime minister
must decide this, and Arafat has something to say about this,
too.''
	   Wednesday's three-way meeting was held at the Erez crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Albright, Netanyahu and Arafat
did not speak to reporters during their separate arrivals.
	   Albright is nudging, 3rd graf pvs.
