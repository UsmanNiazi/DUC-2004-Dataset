<HEADLINE> Albright Takes Alaska Fishing Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOLDOTNA, Alaska (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
turned an Alaskan refueling stop Thursday into a half-day 
excursion, taking a sight-seeing flight over glaciers and fjords 
and later casting for salmon in the fast-running Kenai River. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do need a lesson,'' Albright said as she tenatively tried  
her hand at fishing at a private fishing lodge in this community 
about 150 miles southwest of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's overnight visit came as she headed to Singapore for  
an Asian diplomatic conference to be followed by a visit to the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was coaxed on by Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, who had  
caught a 60-pound king salmon from a boat in roughly the same spot 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On her first cast, Albright's line tangled with that of another  
angler. ``I need the whole river,'' she joked. 
</P>
<P>
	When she failed to land anything, her aides were  
characteristically diplomatic, contending she had been casting, not 
fishing, and that next time she would be fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving in Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage and  
speaking to base personnel, Albright and her traveling party 
boarded a two-engine propeller-driven aircraft for a flight south 
to Seward, and then over the nearby Harding Icefield and the Kenai 
Fjords National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright visited a lodge owned by Bob Penney, who gave her  
pointers on fishing with a fly from his fishing deck. A local 
sporting goods store owner, Jim Golden, presented her with a 
temporary fishing license. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's legal,'' he joked. Albright thanked him.  
</P>
<P>
	Golden later said he paid $10 for the 24-hour  
out-of-state-resident license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish she'd stay longer,'' he said. ``The fishing is good,  
but the catching is slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stayed long enough to eat some grilled pieces from the  
salmon the governor had caught. And she apologized for her short 
visit, but noted, ``This is about as long as I'm anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said a key subject of the meeting in Singapore of the  
Association of Southeast Asian Nations would be tensions caused by 
wide speculation that North Korea was on the verge of launching 
another multi-stage missile, as it did last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Korea ``perhaps the most dangerous place on earth  
today,'' Albright said, ``Our goal is to encourage the government 
of North Korea to end its isolation and choose the path of 
cooperation.''
