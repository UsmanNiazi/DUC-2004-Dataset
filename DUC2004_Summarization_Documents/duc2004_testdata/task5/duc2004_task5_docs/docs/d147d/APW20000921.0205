   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Nearly a year after the Senate rejected a state
Supreme Court judge's nomination to a federal judgeship, the
decision is reverberating in Missouri's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan told a Missouri Bar Association
forum on diversity that Judge Ronnie White was ''one of my proudest
appointments.'' Carnahan appointed him to the state Supreme Court
in 1995, making him the court's first black judge.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's general election opponent, incumbent Republican Sen.
John Ashcroft, led the fight against White's nomination. Carnahan
did not address the controversy over White's federal nomination,
but it came up because White himself said Thursday that the
rejection will have a ''chilling effect'' on the desire of young
blacks to enter the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist at the forum, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, said
he believes race was an issue, adding: ''I hope the citizens of
Missouri will remember it when it comes time to vote for U.S.
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about the comments in St. Louis, David James, an Ashcroft
campaign spokesman, said: ''The race-baiting by Mel Carnahan has
begun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mel Carnahan's liberal judge wasn't confirmed because law
enforcement officers across Missouri opposed his record of
overturning death penalty cases on legal technicalities,'' James
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ashcroft had voted in the Senate for more than 90
percent of minority candidates for the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Carnahan, Tony Wyche, responded that Ashcroft
had developed a questionable record on race relations, including
his fight against White.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, more than 300 supporters of White's nomination
rallied at the Old Courthouse to denounce the opposition from
Ashcroft and fellow Republican Bond to White, whose nomination was
rejected on a party-line vote Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he was opposed to White in the belief that he was
soft on the death penalty and ''pro-criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters labeled Ashcroft a racist, although Carnahan
said only that Ashcroft had been insensitive and that the
controversy had racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans replied by circulating a 39-year-old picture of
Carnahan in blackface in a minstrel show. The governor apologized
for his own insensitivity.
