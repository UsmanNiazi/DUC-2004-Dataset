<HEADLINE> Victims' Rights Hearing Held in Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Three months after Pope John Paul II persuaded  
Gov. Mel Carnahan to halt the execution of a convicted killer, the 
governor's action became the center of a hearing Saturday on 
victims' rights conducted by the senator Carnahan wants to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Missouri law, a killer's victims must be notified of a  
decision to grant clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't happen in late January when Carnahan, at the  
pope's urging, commuted the death sentence of Darrell Mease. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, who faces a  
re-election challenge from Carnahan, held a hearing on victims' 
rights that featured relatives of Mease's victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Willie Lawrence said a simple telephone call by  
Carnahan telling them of his action would have helped heal the pain 
in learning Mease no longer faced the death sentence for killing 
their paraplegic, 19-year-old son in 1988. Mease also was charged 
with murdering Lawrence's grandparents, but was never tried for 
those killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they learned of the commutation from the nightly news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like learning they were dead again,'' said an  
emotional Anita Lawrence, Willie's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease had been scheduled to die by injection on Feb. 10.  
</P>
<P>
	The issue might have died if Carnahan were not challenging  
Ashcroft for his Senate seat in the next election. Ashcroft has 
kept the topic alive, frequently speaking out against Carnahan's 
mistake in not calling the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent experience of the Lawrence family had made clear  
the profound impact that a commutation can have on the victims of 
crime,'' Ashcroft said during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the hearing was aimed not at Carnahan but rather focused  
on a proposal before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a proposed 
national victims' rights constitutional amendment. It would give 
victims of violent crime the right to be notified of proceedings, 
the right to make statements at all stages in the process and the 
right to be notified of a convict's release or escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this hearing is not to allocate responsibility  
to anyone,'' Ashcroft said. ``This is a hearing to learn how we can 
structure the proposal to protect families' rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft wants the amendment to also cover commutations.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Lawrence testimony will help us convince the members of  
the senate that the amendment is too narrow,'' Ashcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawrences' attorney, Mark Richardson, said the family asked  
to testify at the hearing. Mrs. Lawrence and her husband, Buck, 
came at their own expense from their home in Big Fork, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan did not attend the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to the Lawrence family is very tragic,'' said  
the governor's spokesman, Chris Sifford. ``The governor is very 
sympathetic. We think it also is tragic that Ashcroft would attempt 
to exploit the family by making them relive it.''
