<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Gov. Mel Carnahan apologized Monday for
appearing in blackface makeup in a 1960 minstrel show but accused
Republican U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft of orchestrating the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's office denied the allegation. Carnahan, a Democrat
who is seeking the Republican Ashcroft's Senate post, contends
Ashcroft wants to distract attention from recent accusations that
he was guilty of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments came one day after Missouri Republicans
circulated a 39-year-old newspaper photo of Carnahan in blackface
makeup performing in a minstrel show in Rolla, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said that, while minstrel shows were offensive, even
those who backed civil rights early failed to recognize how
offensive the shows were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly regret my participation in this kind of theater
and I sincerely and readily apologize for my insensitivity of 39
years ago,'' he said. Carnahan was 26 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he and his brother Bob were part of a Kiwanis
Club barbershop quartet that performed at fund-raisers. He said
Rolla was ``not very far advanced'' on civil rights in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he participated in the minstrel show, Carnahan said,
``I cannot explain that except to say it was insensitive and I wish
it were not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did stop the practice and I feel like I have grown and
I am proud that I have grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said that he and his brother helped convince the
organization to end the annual minstrel show in 1961 and replace it
with a variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he said, he sponsored legislation in the
Missouri General Assembly that became law that banned
discrimination in public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also noted that in 1995 he named Ronnie White as
the first African-American member of the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the same Ronnie White whose character and record were
irresponsibly assailed by the senator (Ashcroft) who is now trying
to raise questions about my attitudes on race,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft played a key role in the U.S. Senate's rejection
earlier this month of White's nomination for a federal judgeship.
Ashcroft said White had a weak record on capital punishment and
drug enforcement and was opposed by various law enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two black members of Congress, including Rep. William Clay of
St. Louis, called Ashcroft racist last week for his role in White's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said Monday that Ashcroft's Senate campaign and GOP
operatives gave the Carnahan photo to reporters to distract
attention from Ashcroft's role in White's rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the information, they put it out and they are
responsible for it,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Ashcroft is counting on Missourians to be unable to
see any difference between the insensitivity in this photograph
four decades ago and the polarizing acts he committed on the Senate
floor just days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hilton, Ashcroft's spokesman, said Monday the senator's
office did not distribute the photo. He said many Missourians were
aware of its existence and they were angered over charges of racism
leveled at Ashcroft in light of that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft didn't tell Mel Carnahan to perform in
blackface,'' Hilton said. ``We didn't take the photo of a demeaning
minstrel show. Mel Carnahan needs to answer for his own conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan told reporters that while Ashcroft's opposition to
White showed insensitivity he was not accusing him of being racist.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's office, however, cited a weekend news story in which
Carnahan said Ashcroft's opposition to White ``had racial
overtones.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, executive director of the state GOP, criticized
Carnahan's comments about the photo and denied any role in its
release. He said it was ``leaked to the news media by an anonymous
source.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The original dirty trick was when Mel Carnahan decided to
appear in blackface at a time when he was launching his political
career,'' Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he did not think the issue would hurt his standing
with African-American voters in next year's Senate showdown. He
said politicians should be judged on their record and whether they
have grown.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carson Ross, a Blue Springs Republican, criticized Carnahan
on Sunday and compared wearing blackface to hoods worn by the Ku
Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said Monday those comments were an ``overreaction'' and
accused Ross of being the spokesman ``for this dastardly attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross denied that and said, as an African-American who grew up in
Arkansas in the 1950s and 1960s, minstrel shows struck a sensitive
chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not innocent when you start mocking a group of people or
degrading a group of people,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Carnahan's apology Monday, Ross said, ``That is all I am
asking.''
