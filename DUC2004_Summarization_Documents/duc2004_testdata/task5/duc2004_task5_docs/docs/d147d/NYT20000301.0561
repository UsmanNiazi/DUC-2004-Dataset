   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The marquee match-up between Republican John
Ashcroft and Democrat Mel Carnahan for the U.S. Senate in Missouri
is a statistical dead heat, with Ashcroft holding a narrow lead,
according to a recent statewide survey.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, the incumbent senator, led Carnahan, the two-term
governor, by 47 percent to 44 percent, according to the poll
commissioned by The Kansas City Star. The survey had a
4-percentage-point margin of error, so the race is a tossup eight
months before Election Day in November.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research, was taken from
Friday to Monday and involved 628 registered Missouri voters who
said they vote regularly in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated that only 9 percent of likely voters said
they were undecided, an unusually low total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really remarkable,'' said Carnahan aide Marc Farinella.
``It's an indication that there are very few voters available to
either side.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll revealed another unusual circumstance: Neither
candidate faces the costly hurdle of having to improve his name
identification. Ashcroft and Carnahan are recognized by virtually
every Missourian. The poll said only 1 percent of voters were
unfamiliar with Ashcroft. Carnahan was known by 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both had similar favorable-unfavorable ratings. Ashcroft was
recognized positively by 48 percent, compared with 23 percent who
viewed him unfavorably. Twenty-eight percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's totals: 46 percent favorable, 27 percent unfavorable
and 27 percent neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's a positive result,'' Ashcroft spokesman Steve
Hilton said. ``It says that Senator Ashcroft's issues and his
record are well-known to people. We are very comfortable with our
position at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Republican poll showed Ashcroft leading by 10 points,
Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Farinella also viewed the new poll's totals with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistent with all the other polls we've seen in this
race,'' he said. ``We read it as very positive news for us. We
don't really expect to be ahead of an incumbent senator at this
point in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   He viewed Ashcroft's failure to grab more than 50 percent
support as a sign of weakness for an incumbent officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan led Ashcroft in the state's two major urban areas. The
Democrat topped Ashcroft 50 percent to 44 percent in Kansas City
and 49 percent to 43 percent in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft led in the four rural regions, taking his biggest
advantage in his home area of southwest Missouri, where he led 56
percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also revealed a gender gap. Ashcroft led among men by
53 percent to 40 percent while Carnahan led among women, 48 percent
to 41 percent.
