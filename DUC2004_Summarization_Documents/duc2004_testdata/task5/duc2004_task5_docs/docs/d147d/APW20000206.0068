<HEADLINE> Political Bigs Battle in Missouri  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- On a chilly November evening, Missouri's leading
contenders for the U.S. Senate rose from their tables at a chamber of commerce
dinner and made their way toward one another. They shook hands and exchanged
pleasantries.
</P>
<P>
   The mannerly encounter between Republican Sen. John Ashcroft and Democratic
Gov. Mel Carnahan contrasted mightily with the reality of a race that, for sheer
hostility, has at times rivaled the New York brawl between Hillary Rodham
Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and Rudy are tame by comparison,'' said Norm Ornstein, an analyst
at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research center. ``The bottom
line here is that you just don't usually see this level of personal acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The two camps have been relatively civil since the handshake -- they even
signed a ``Framework of Civility'' last week -- but few people expect a lasting
truce.
</P>
<P>
   After all, animosity between the men goes back more than a decade when, as
governor, Ashcroft went to court to ensure Carnahan -- then the lieutenant
governor -- could not become acting governor when Ashcroft took trips outside
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Their Senate campaign began when Carnahan declared his candidacy a full two
years before the 2000 election. It has featured allegations of racism that
included a 40-year-old photo of Carnahan in blackface, and a battle over capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty controversy began after Carnahan met with Pope John Paul
II in January 1999 and two days later commuted a murderer's death sentence
without notifying the victim's parents, as required by Missouri law.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft responded by having the parents of the 19-year-old paraplegic man
testify before a Senate committee hearing, this one in St. Louis where the
pontiff had asked that the killer's life be spared.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Missouri political analysts and observers have remarked on the
dislike between Ashcroft and Carnahan. Both continue to say their relationship
has been misrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, reporters tell me, and they report, that the governor has a very
serious dislike for me,'' Ashcroft said last year. ``And I don't understand that
because I don't have any reason to dislike the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, whose father was a congressman and U.S. ambassador, says he and
Ashcroft ``have almost no personal relationship. I think the characterization of
it is much overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are well-liked by voters but come from opposite ends of the political
spectrum. Ashcroft allies call the governor a tax-and-spend liberal; Carnahan's
campaign labels the senator a right-wing extremist.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a fundamentalist minister, Ashcroft, 57, is a social and fiscal
conservative. During his two-term governorship, he signed restrictive abortion
laws later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who will turn 66 on Friday, succeeded Ashcroft seven years ago and
has vetoed a concealed weapons bill and legislation to further restrict
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashcroft ran for the Senate in 1994, Carnahan ridiculed what he called
Ashcroft's do-nothing policies as governor. And one day after the 1998 election,
Carnahan launched his challenge, calling himself a moderate progressive and
attacking Ashcroft's ``radical, far-right views.''
</P>
<P>
   Then mulling a bid for the White House, Ashcroft took himself out of the
running to focus on the Senate race. And he softened his rhetoric on abortion
and President Clinton's character.
</P>
<P>
   Things got ugly in a hurry. In the fall, Missouri Republicans circulated the
old photograph of Carnahan singing in blackface. Carnahan accused Ashcroft of
having his operatives pass it around. Ashcroft denied responsibility, then
claimed Carnahan was responsible for allegations of racism directed at him after
a black judge's nomination was defeated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact signed last week, the two pledged to ``refrain from using
deception, half-truths, falsification or innuendo in describing your
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier negativity of the campaign turned off some voters, and may have
contributed to the cease fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of them has struck me as being particularly senatorial in their
campaigns,'' Eddie Adelstein, a 62-year-old pathologist, said in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are well-funded. Ashcroft has taken in $4.7 million and has
at least $3.4 million on hand, compared to Carnahan's $3.9 million raised and
$2.5 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Their bankrolls mean they can end their cease-fire and begin lobbing attacks
any time. Ornstein expects that will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start down this path, it's difficult to stop,'' he said. ``Even
if you as a candidate want to stop, the people around you don't. They get upset,
they get charged up.''
