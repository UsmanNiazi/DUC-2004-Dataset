   WASHINGTON _ As Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Gov. Mel
Carnahan scout for contributions in their U.S. Senate race, they're
hitting their biggest pay dirt with companies and individuals
giving unregulated ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has helped raise about $500,000 in such donations since
the start of last year, including two $50,000 corporate
contributions. Carnahan has helped raised $262,000, including
$50,000 from an individual and two $25,000 corporate donations.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money cannot be used by candidates themselves. Instead, it
is transferred to committees set up by their political parties and
used for advertising and party-building to benefit candidates
nationwide. There are no donation limits, which has drawn
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft set up the Ashcroft Victory Committee, which works with
the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Carnahan set up
Missouri 2000 with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Senate and House candidates have set up such committees
to raise soft money, as have national party committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission says that in the 15 months that
ended March 30, $85 million has been raised for Republican
committees and $77 million for Democratic committees. That is
nearly double amounts for the same period two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing both sides raising records amounts of money,''
said Jeff Cronin, spokesman for Common Cause, which wants soft
money banned. ``They are giving to both sides in the same race.
This is not about ideology. It's about access and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan would stop taking soft money if Ashcroft would do the
same, said Carnahan campaign manager Marc Farinella. That doesn't
surprise Ashcroft supporters, given how much more money he is
raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe campaign contributions are free speech and that the
First Amendment protects people's rights to participate in the
political process,'' said Jonathan Grella, spokesman for the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the soft money, Carnahan's Missouri 2000 has raised
$613,000 in ``hard money'' for Carnahan's Senate campaign and for
the Democratic senatorial committee. It is called hard money
because there are limits on donations. The Ashcroft Victory
Committee has raised $1.3 million in hard money.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's Grella said Carnahan has not been very effective in
raising money for his Missouri 2000 Committee, given that he is a
sitting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a race that has two incumbents, in essence,'' Grella
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan supporters said an incumbent senator has a natural
advantage over any challenger because of the influence a senator
holds and his connections in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A ``vulnerable Republican'' such as Ashcroft could be expected
to be even more pressed to raise money from special interests, said
Jim Jordan of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said his committee realizes that soft money is a
sensitive public issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only position this committee has on soft money is that
it's, sadly enough, a necessary evil in politics,'' Jordan said.
``We play the cards as we are dealt them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carnahan's soft-money committee trails Ashcroft's in
raising money, Carnahan's own committee for his Senate race is
keeping pace of late.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months that ended March 31, Carnahan was slightly
ahead with $2.9 million. But dating back to the beginning of the
campaign two years ago, Ashcroft has raised $5.9 million, about $1
million more than Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of soft money, the biggest corporate contributions to
the Ashcroft Victory Committee, at $50,000, came from St.
Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Companies and from the drugmaker
Schering Corp., also known as Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strive for balance,'' Anheuser-Busch spokesman Jim Schwartz
said. ``Over the long term, we try to support candidates on both
sides.'' The company gave $25,000 to Carnahan's Missouri 2000 in
December and may give more, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Schering spokesman William O'Donnell said its $50,000 donation
to the Ashcroft Victory Committee was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Ashcroft has emerged as one of the important new
leaders in the U.S. Senate,'' O'Donnell said. ``He is widely
recognized as an advocate for the advancement of technology and the
protection of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan campaign spokesman Tony Wyche questioned whether the
Schering donation resulted from Ashcroft's co-sponsorship of a bill
the company wanted last summer that could protect drug patents,
such as the Schering drug Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does nothing specifically for Schering-Plough,''
Ashcroft campaign spokesman David James said. ``It has to do with a
lot of companies. John Ashcroft supports the protection of
lifesaving research, which this bill provides.''
</P>
<P>
   The main sponsor of the bill was Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New
Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. Schering also gave $50,000 to that committee.
</P>
<P>
   The largest soft-money contributor to Carnahan was education
consultant Peter Buttenwieser of Philadelphia, who also gave
$50,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and has
backed other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect (Carnahan) very much and I feel his winning is
important for Missouri and the country,'' Buttenwieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri 2000 got its second largest soft-money contribution,
$25,000, from the Mills Corp. of Arlington, Va., a real estate
trust company that helps develop and manage shopping centers in
Missouri and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rivers, executive vice president of Mills, said that the
company gave to Missouri 2000 because it was asked to and that it
developed a relationship with Carnahan while providing jobs under a
welfare-to-work program in the state two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest corporate soft-money donor from Kansas City was CNS
Corp., the holding company for Ozark National Life Insurance. It
gave $25,000 to the Ashcroft Victory Committee. In addition, Ozark
Chief Executive Officer S.A. Weber of Olathe gave $14,000 in hard
money to the Ashcroft Victory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, we supported (former) Governor Ashcroft for many
years,'' Weber said. ``He is a good man, and we'd like to keep him
in the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin of Common Cause said laws allowing soft money give large
corporations and rich people too much influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes political parties less reliant on the grass roots,
where they traditionally went for their support,'' Cronin said.
``It's made them more reliant on wealthy special interests.''
