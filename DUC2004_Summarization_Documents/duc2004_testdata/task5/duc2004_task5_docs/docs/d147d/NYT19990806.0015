   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's campaign fund for the
U.S. Senate is about $765,000 smaller than that of Sen. John
Ashcroft's, reports show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three weeks ago the governor was two months late
filing his personal financial disclosure form with the Senate,
although he avoided a $200 fine. Carnahan, a Democrat in his second
term as governor, had about $1.48 million in cash on hand for the
period that ended July 1, compared with about $2.24 million for the
Republican Ashcroft, according to reports filed with the secretary
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan spent $545,647 on fund-raising events, travel, staff
salaries and other expenses in the six months, compared with
$423,519 for Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   For the period, Ashcroft raised more money than Carnahan did:
$2.09 million for Ashcroft, $1.44 million for Carnahan. Both had
cash-on-hand carried over from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan campaign adviser Roy Temple said that fund raising had
gone well and that the $2.1 million the governor raised dating back
to last year was already approaching the $2.5 million that Missouri
Attorney General Jay Nixon raised in his losing bid for Senate last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always understood that as a sitting U.S. senator, John
Ashcroft was going to have the capacity to raise more money,''
Temple said. ``The question is, did we raise enough to get the
governor's message out, and we think we have.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to campaign reports, U.S. senators and candidates
must file forms outlining their personal financial holdings and
sources of income. Carnahan filed a form when he declared for
Senate last fall, but he failed to file again by May 17, as
required.
</P>
<P>
   Temple said a staff person who misunderstood the filing schedule
made the mistake. Being more than 30 days late with a report
results in a $200 late filing penalty, unless waived by the Senate
ethics office.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan filed the report July 13 after being notified by the
Senate secretary that it was due. Temple said the campaign
committee sent a letter with the form asking for a waiver of the
$200 penalty because the notice from the Senate secretary did not
come until after the 30 days had expired.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, the ethics panel staff director wrote Carnahan a
letter agreeing to waive the fine, based on the circumstances and
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hilton, spokesman for Ashcroft, said Carnahan's failure to
file on time ``has to be the result of carelessness, inattention or
a lack of respect for the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft did not file his personal financial disclosure form May
15, but he requested and received an extension until Aug. 15.
Hilton said documents Ashcroft needed to accurately fill out the
form were unavailable in May.
