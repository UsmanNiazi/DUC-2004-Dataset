NEW WHISTLE-STOP TOUR TAKES CARNAHAN THROUGH MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When President Harry S. Truman made the last speech
of his historic whistle-stop train tour in the 1948 presidential
campaign, Mel Carnahan was in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Carnahan embarked on a four-day, whistle-stop tour
of his own, rolling through the Missouri countryside in search of
votes to help him win Truman's old seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, Missouri's two-term governor, can only hope his tour
and the fall election follow in Truman's tracks. In an interview,
he remembered the Truman speech vividly, even though he was only
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Saturday night before the Tuesday election, a rousing
crowd,'' Carnahan said. ``He was chipper, confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's tour, on a seven-car chartered Amtrak train,
began in St. Louis before a crowd of 200 supporters. The train then
stopped in Elsberry, Louisiana and Hannibal before going on to
Moberly, where the governor will hold a rally to begin today's leg
of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, a crowd of 75 to 100 sign-toting supporters had
gathered at old train depots or rusted silos. Carnahan, speaking
from the back platform of the train, said he would better represent
the average Missourian than has incumbent John Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Truman wouldn't want John Ashcroft filling his seat,''
Carnahan said. ``Harry Truman's seat will go back to the working
people.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carnahan called the 22-stop tour a way to reach out to the
voters across the state, the Missouri Republican Party called it a
``luxurious train ride'' that should address tax increases he
imposed as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he continues to attack his opponent, Mel Carnahan needs to
explain why he is punishing working families with record high
taxes,'' party Executive Director John Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Hancock said Carnahan oversaw the biggest
state tax increase in U.S. history when he signed Senate Bill 380,
a $315 million tax increase to pay for education.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's campaign manager, Marc Farinella, was quick to
respond, comparing the tax histories of the governor and Ashcroft,
who served as governor from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``During John Ashcroft's two terms as governor, he raised taxes
by a half billion dollars,'' Farinella said. ``He never passed a
tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Farinella said taxes over the nearly eight years of Carnahan's
tenure have dropped by a net of $315 million. The increase in 1993
was mainly on the personal income of the wealthiest 11 percent of
taxpayers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the state Republican party said Carnahan was ``railroading
Missouri,'' the Ashcroft camp had criticism of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel Carnahan feels forced to go places he doesn't normally go
to explain his record of imposing high taxes on working families,''
said Ashcroft campaign spokesman David James.
</P>
<P>
   Making the trip with Carnahan are various supporters, including
labor leaders, large contributors and other Democratic state
candidates. One car is called the ``donor car.'' Carnahan and the
other candidates are sharing the cost of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   One of the speakers Wednesday was John Truman, the grandnephew
of Harry Truman. He likened Carnahan to Truman and took an apparent
stab at Ashcroft's ties to the Christian coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry used to say, `If a man at church is too loud with his
amens, he's probably a horse thief,' &UR; '' Truman said. ``You never
had to lock your barn with President Truman. I see in Gov. Carnahan
the same qualities I saw in Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan and other Missouri Democrats denounced Ashcroft's
record in the Senate, saying he only appears to support
initiatives, such as a patients' bill of rights and prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But, said former Sen. Tom Eagleton, ``when John Ashcroft goes
back to Washington, he votes against every single one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Attorney General Jay Nixon, ``Do not fall for his
slick efforts to redefine himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan plans to emphasize a different subject on each day of
his tour. Wednesday, it was health care. Today it will be rural
issues, such as the Freedom to Farm bill, and Friday it will be
seniors' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said the 1996 farm bill is significantly contributing
to low farm prices and that subsidies should have been built in to
prepare for lean years. Ashcroft is too patient in letting the bill
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said the problem with the farm bill is that government
is not keeping its commitments to enforce trade deals with foreign
partners that would open markets to American goods.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of Carnahan's schedule: Today, Moberly,
Salisbury, Henrietta, Independence, Harrisonville and Nevada. He
will be in Independence about 2:30 p.m. and Harrisonville about
4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: Joplin, Aurora, Springfield, Lebanon, Rolla and
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Crystal City, Ste. Genevieve, Cape Girardeau,
Sikeston, Portageville and Hayti.
