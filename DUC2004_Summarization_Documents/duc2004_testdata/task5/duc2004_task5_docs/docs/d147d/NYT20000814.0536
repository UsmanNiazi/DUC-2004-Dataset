ASHCROFT'S ABSENCE AT CONVENTION WAS INTENTIONAL, CARNAHAN CLAIMS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Republican John Ashcroft did not speak to the
Republican National Convention, because George W. Bush wanted to
distance himself from conservative members of Congress, Democrat
Mel Carnahan charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ashcroft, whom Carnahan is challenging for a
second term in the U.S. Senate from Missouri this November, shot
back that Ashcroft, in fact, was invited to speak to the GOP
convention earlier this month but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft thought it was more important to listen to
Missouri's working families,'' Ashcroft spokesman David James said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan did not buy that explanation. Two days before his own
convention speech, now tentatively set for Wednesday afternoon, the
two-term governor said the decision to keep Ashcroft off the stage
in Philadelphia was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very conscious decision on the part of the handlers
and managers of the Republican convention to not show the far-right
wing of their party,'' Carnahan said. ``And it was part of the
effort to really masquerade or cover up what the Republican
Congress is really about.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Ashcroft, who also served two terms as Missouri's
governor, was not the only conservative who was kept from the
public. Others included Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, House
Majority Leader Dick Armey and Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's speech Wednesday will not be on prime-time TV, so the
governor said he had no idea how valuable the speech would be for
his campaign. But he said he was pleased to be invited.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan also addressed the convention four years ago. This time
he expects to review some of the accomplishments of his years in
office and some of the issues he would focus on as senator.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, Ashcroft's campaign noted Monday that Carnahan
accepted a $2,000 donation in June from Christie Hefner, head of
Playboy Enterprises. James said Carnahan should return the money
and ``distance himself from the low morals of the pornography
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have canceled a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan aide Tony Wyche said the campaign would not return the
money. He pointed to what he called a questionable donation
Ashcroft had received from a New Jersey drug manufacturer shortly
after Ashcroft passed a bill helpful to the company.
