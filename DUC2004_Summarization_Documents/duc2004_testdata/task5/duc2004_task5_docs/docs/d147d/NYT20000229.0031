UNIVERSITY

   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan said Monday that Sen.
John Ashcroft should return the honorary degree he got from Bob
Jones University and release a text of a commencement speech he
gave at the South Carolina school last May.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a Democrat trying to unseat the Republican Ashcroft,
said the senator should not have spoken at a university that bans
interracial dating and whose leaders have used terms such as
``demons'' and ``satanistic cults'' to describe Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was bad judgment on his part,'' Carnahan said
during a visit to Washington for the National Governors'
Association conference. ``Certainly (the university) has divisive
teaching practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft showed no inclination Monday to return the degree or to
release a copy of his remarks made to students last May. Chief of
staff David Ayres called Carnahan ``the worst kind of politician:
One who will say or do anything to get elected. Carnahan's campaign
strategy apparently will treat Missourians to a parade of politics
of personal destruction, a series of nasty attacks on John
Ashcroft's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayres said Carnahan's real motive is to shore up support among
Catholics in the wake of his veto of a bill banning so-called
partial-birth abortions. Ayres said Ashcroft ``did not attempt to
exploit the anti-Catholic position taken by Carnahan'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft did not know about the specific teachings of Bob Jones
University when he spoke in May and still doesn't, spokesman Steve
Hilton said last week. Carnahan said Ashcroft should co-sponsor a
Senate resolution that condemns the school's divisive teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Mel Carnahan knows, John Ashcroft totally repudiates
attacks on Americans' religious faiths and policies that divide
Americans on a racial basis, like those at Bob Jones University,''
Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan raised the issue a day after Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said he regretted not taking the
university's views to task when he spoke there Feb. 2. Bush wrote a
letter of apology to Cardinal John O'Connor, Catholic archbishop of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly took note of the fact that even George Bush has
finally taken steps to disassociate himself from teachings of the
university,'' said Marc Farinella, campaign manager for Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton said the degree Ashcroft got is a ``common courtesy'' to
a guest speaker and that the speech he gave was extemporaneous.
Hilton said he did not have a text.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said the text of the speech ``would shed light on how
much Senator Ashcroft actually did and did not know about the
university's teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has not tried to downplay his commencement appearance.
He mentioned it in a family Christmas card recapping highlights of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Republicans said Carnahan was making too much of the
Bob Jones speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me you speak to a lot of people in politics that
don't share your views,'' said John Hancock, executive director of
the Missouri Republican Party. ``This is typical of the way
Democrats run their campaigns. They will race-bait and
Christian-bash at every opportunity.''
