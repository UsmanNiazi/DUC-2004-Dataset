 Sponsor of abortion bill accuses governor of making a political
threat

<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The House sponsor of a bitterly debated
abortion bill on Tuesday accused Gov. Mel Carnahan, a fellow
Democrat, of having leveled a political threat against him before
last week's showdown over the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus, a Josephville Democrat, said Carnahan
told him at a late-night meeting in his Capitol office that he
``would turn Catholic women against me'' in Luetkenhaus'
legislative district if lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said Carnahan knows there are numerous Catholic
voters in his eastern Missouri legislative district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Are you threatening me, Governor?' And then he
changed the subject,'' Luetkenhaus recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my response was, `Governor, are you threatening me for
fighting for something I believe in?' '' he said. ``Then he danced
around the issue and moved to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he interpreted Carnahan's comments, Luetkenhaus said
Tuesday, ``I took it as a threat, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said he expected primary opposition next year for
the first time since he was elected to the House in 1992. He said
he did not know whether the governor would get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nachtigal, Carnahan's press secretary, disputed
Luetkenhaus' allegations and said the meeting focused on
differences over the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told there was no discussion of reprisals or the governor
lining up primary opponents or campaigning against any Democrats
who didn't side with him,'' Nachtigal said Tuesday from Chicago,
where the governor was traveling. ``Those threats, real or implied,
just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus is one of the leaders of the House anti-abortion
forces. Carnahan, who favors abortion rights, waged an intense
campaign to have his veto sustained.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after the meeting, the House, at the urging of
Luetkenhaus, overrode Carnahan's veto, 127-34, and the Missouri
Senate did the same the following day. It was a rebuke to the
governor, especially since his fellow Democrats control both
chambers, and was just the third time this century that a
governor's veto had been overridden.
</P>
<P>
   Backers said the bill would ban a late-term abortion procedure _
which they label ``partial-birth'' abortion _ by classifying it as
infanticide. Carnahan contends that the legislation would ban
abortions as early as 5 weeks of gestation and provide a legal
defense for violence against abortion doctors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright issued a temporary
restraining order against the new law on Friday after a lawsuit was
filed that challenged its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said his meeting with Carnahan lasted from about 9
p.m. to 11:30 p.m. and included Chris Sifford, gubernatorial chief
of staff. Nachtigal, however, said Sifford denied Luetkenhaus'
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said that while the session was polite and civil,
the governor was clearly agitated by his stance.
</P>
<P>
   He said Carnahan had accused him of ``playing God with women's
lives'' because the measure failed to include a health exception.
Luetkenhaus said he replied that the bill allowed the procedure to
save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told Carnahan: ``I am not playing God. I pray to God,
and that is why I am able to sit here and take this kind of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he changed the subject again.''
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said Carnahan also made a general comment about
turning women against other lawmakers who voted to override his
veto.
