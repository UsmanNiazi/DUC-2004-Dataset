<HEADLINE> UNABOM Suspect Indicted in New Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A federal grand jury in
Newark, New Jersey, has indicted UNBOM suspect Theodore Kaczynski
on charges of mailing the bomb that killed advertising executive
Thomas Mosser in December 1994, the Justice Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was being held in Sacramento, California, where he
was indicted in June on 10 separate counts in the killing of two
other men and wounding two others.
</P>
<P>
"As with the earlier charges filed against Mr. Kaczynski in
Sacramento, California, these charges are the result of a
multi-agency investigation by the (San Francisco-based) UNABOM
Task Force into a series of bombings that occurred across the
United States beginning in 1978," Attorney General Janet Reno said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The department intends to prosecute Kaczynski in New Jersey
after the trial in Sacramento, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to today's indictment, Kaczynski allegedly
transported the bomb that killed Mosser from Montana to San
Francisco, then mailed it to Mosser's home in North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
When Mosser opened the package, it exploded and killed him.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is the only suspect in 16 bombings that killed three
people and injured 23.
</P>
<P>
A major break in the decades-long investigation came when
Kaczynski's brother, David, a social worker from Schenectady,
N.Y., contacted authorities last year.
</P>
<P>
Theodore Kaczynski was subsequently arrested in a remote cabin
near Lincoln, Montana.
