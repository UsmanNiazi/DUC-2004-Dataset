   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a small boy, Theodore John Kaczynski feared
people and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In school, where he skipped from the fifth to seventh grades, he
felt he didn't fit in, had no friends and was the object of
classmates' teasing.
</P>
<P>
   As a Harvard University undergraduate, he was diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic but was never treated.
</P>
<P>
   In graduate school he became more isolated, frustrated with his
inability to form relationships with women, and considered getting
a sex-change operation. When his attempt to seek counseling ended
in humiliation, he thought of killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just then, there came a major turning point in my life,'' he
later told a prison psychiatrist. ``What was entirely new was the
fact that I really felt that I could kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski's enveloping madness is detailed in a 47-page
psychiatric study that was a key factor in his January plea to
being the Unabomber, responsible for an 18-year string of bombings,
beginning in 1978, that killed three and wounded 23 others.
</P>
<P>
   The report was filed under seal in Sacramento federal court
where Kaczynski was charged, but was made public Friday in response
to a legal motion by the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The study was prepared by Dr. Sally Johnson, a federal prison
psychiatrist who interviewed Kaczynski for more than 19 hours,
interviewed his family, and reviewed his copious writings on the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The deepest psychological study of the 55-year-old Kaczynski to
date, it reaches a provisional but convincing conclusion that his
methodical bombings stemmed from severe mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read this and you get the impression that certainly Ted
Kaczynski is in bad shape psychologically,'' said Michael Rustigan,
a criminologist at San Francisco State University who studies
serial killers.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, who turned his brother in to the FBI after
recognizing the Unabomber's published manifesto as similar to
Theodore's other writings, said in an interview Friday that the
study gave an accurate but sometimes surprising picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I became aware of after his arrest was how little
the family did know about how much trouble Ted was having, how much
pain he was in,'' said Kaczynski, an Albany, N.Y., social worker
who counsels disturbed children. ``It only makes sense that his
illness should have some mitigating effect on his sentence, which
it apparently did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Freccero, one of the
prosecutors, said the study was one of several reasons why the
government accepted the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski previously had offered to plead guilty only if he
could appeal pretrial rulings, with a possibility of reversing his
conviction. After the report was issued he offered to plead
unconditionally, Freccero said, which meant he'd spend the
remainder of his life in prison. Going to trial risked a jury
decision to spare him because of his mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that he was always first and foremost a killer,''
Freccero said.
</P>
<P>
   The report traces Kaczynski's lonely progression from the
shyness of childhood to the peaks of paranoia and the machinations
of a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1942, he grew up near Chicago, the oldest son of a
housewife and a sausage maker who shot himself to death in 1990
after being diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He was a bright child but feared people and buildings, and
tended to play beside other children rather than with them, his
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski told Johnson that as a child he suffered ``extreme
verbal and emotional abuse,'' though the report did not confirm
that.
</P>
<P>
   He described skipping sixth grade as a pivotal event in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembers not fitting in with the older children and being
the subject of considerable verbal abuse and teasing from them,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, who is seven years younger than his brother,
said: ``Nothing in my family strikes me as abusive. If anything, we
made great efforts to be supportive, to build up his self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski remained hurt by ``the kinds of things that
any other child would let roll off his back,'' he said. ``It's as
if he had no emotional immunity, no ability to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson noted that ``it was evident that Mr. Kaczynski is
extremely sensitive to even minor criticism and tends to perceive
this, or even an absence of encouragement or positive response from
an individual, as a deliberate attempt at humiliation or
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central themes involve his belief that he is being
maligned and harassed by family members and modern society.
Consistent with other individuals with persecutory types of
delusions, he is resentful and angry, and fantasizes and actually
does resort to violence against those individuals and organizations
that he believes are hurting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He demonstrates a lack of remorse as indicated in his
writings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reams of Kaczynski's written views were seized at his Montana
cabin when he was arrested in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He frequently expressed both hatred and a wish for revenge and
love and affection for the same individual,'' Johnson added.
