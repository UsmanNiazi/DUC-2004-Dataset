<HEADLINE> Unabomber Lands a Book Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Unabomber has landed a book deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Theodore J. Kaczynski plans to tell his life story in a book to  
be released this spring and proceeds will go to his victims' 
families, a publisher announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beau Friedlander, publisher of Context Media, says ``Truth  
Versus Lies'' is Kaczynski's ``attempt to tell the other side of a 
one-sided tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski is serving a life sentence for 16 bomb attacks that  
killed three people and wounded 29. He pleaded guilty last year in 
Sacramento, Calif., to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that deal, he also agreed to turn over any future  
earnings to the victims' families. He is receiving no advance 
payment for the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski failed last year to shop the book to more established  
New York publishers, including Simon &AMP; Schuster. That's when 
Friedlander said he wrote to the former Berkeley mathematics 
professor in prison and expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a 548-page manuscript last fall and plans to publish  
the book in late May or June. He declined to release an advance 
copy, saying he was still shopping it for serialization by a 
magazine or newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski's previous writing project was a 35,000-word  
anti-technology manifesto published by The New York Times and The 
Washington Post in September 1995. His brother, David, noticed 
similarities to Kaczynski's writings and notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski got a $1 million government reward and has set  
up a fund to distribute about $500,000 to victims of crimes 
committed by paranoid schizophrenics. His brother has been 
diagnosed as a schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedlander said Kaczynski ``is earnest about discovering his  
brother's true motivations for turning him over to the FBI. 
Kaczynski spares no details, even when they show him in a less 
favorable light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Context Media also is releasing a book this spring by Michael  
Mello, a Vermont law professor who has exchanged letters with 
Kaczynski since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski believes he was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty  
and has hired a new lawyer to help him win a second trial, 
according to Mello.
