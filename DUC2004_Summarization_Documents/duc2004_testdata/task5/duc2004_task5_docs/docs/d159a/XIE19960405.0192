<HEADLINE> Unabomber Suspect Charged With Possession of Bomb  Components </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A former University of
California-Berkeley assistant professor of mathematics suspected
of being the Unabomber was charged today with possessing the
components of a bomb found in a search of his mountain cabin in
Montana.
</P>
<P>
FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents found "a
partially completed pipe bomb" and chemicals and "diagrams and
notes" for making pipe bombs in the home of Theodore John
Kaczynski, said an affidavit by FBI agent Donald J. Sachtleben.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, 53, appeared before U.S. District Judge Charles C.
Lovell in federal court in Montana late this morning to hear the
felony charges, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The initial charge did not mention the Unabomber's 18-year
string of bombing attacks, killing three people and injuring 23
others. Federal officials said it was designed to hold Kaczynski
while agents put together a detailed case.
</P>
<P>
In his affidavit, Sachtleben wrote that agents had found a
cylindrical object wrapped in paper in a loft in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
"An X-ray of the package revealed what appears to me to be a
partially completed pipe bomb, including threaded pipe, wire and
other electrical components," Sachtleben wrote.
</P>
<P>
Ten three-ring binders were recovered filled with "page after
page of meticulous writings and sketches which I recognize to be
diagrams of explosive devices," Sachtleben wrote. The diagrams
show cross-sections of pipe bombs and electrical circuitry.
</P>
<P>
"These components... were intended to be readily assembled into
a destructive device such as a pipe bomb," the agent wrote.
</P>
<P>
The search of the cabin could last several days, agents said.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was taken into custody by federal agents Wednesday so
they could search his cabin.
</P>
<P>
The name Unabomber is based on the code name of the case,
"Unabom," because early targets were universities and airlines.
The last bombing was last year.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents had been staking out Kaczynski's hand-built cabin
for several weeks, after relatives in the Chicago area notified
authorities that they had stumbled across some of his old writings
and found them similar to the Unabomber's anarchist manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski graduated from Harvard, and received a master's
degree and doctorate from the University of Michigan.
