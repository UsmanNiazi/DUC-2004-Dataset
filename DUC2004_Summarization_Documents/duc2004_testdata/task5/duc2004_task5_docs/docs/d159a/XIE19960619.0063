WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A federal grand jury charged
Theodore Kaczynski Tuesday with killing two people and injuring
two others during a 18-year-long spree of bombing terror.
</P>
<P>
The 10-count indictment charged the 54-year-old former math
assistant professor with two bombing deaths in Sacramento,
California, according to new reports.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Scrutton was killed while moving a package bomb left
behind his computer store in 1985. California timber industry
lobbyist Gilbert Murray was killed while opening a package bomb
mailed to his office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kaczynski also was charged with mailing bombs from
Sacramento that injured a geneticist at the University of
California, San Francisco, in June 1993, and Yale University
computer scientist in his office the same week.
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Kaczynski transported an explosive device
with the intent to kill or injure, mailed an explosive device with
that intent and used a destructive device in a crime of violence.
</P>
<P>
He could receive the maximum sentence of death or life
imprisonment if convicted of the transporting and mailing counts,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is the only suspect in the series of 16 bombings that
killed three people and injured 23. The third fatality occurred in
1994 in New Jersey, and was not mentioned in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
Investigators used the word, UNABOM, because the initial
targets were airlines and university professors.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was arrested on April 3 at his one-room cabin in
rural Montana and has been held at a Helena, Montana jail on a
single count of possessing bomb parts. He is expected to be
brought to Sacramento by the end of the week for an arraignment.
