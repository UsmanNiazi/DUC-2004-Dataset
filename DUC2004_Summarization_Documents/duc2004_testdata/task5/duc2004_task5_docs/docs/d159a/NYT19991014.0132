   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ David Kaczynski has a deal with a Los
Angeles company for a movie about his life and a pivotal moment in
1996 when he turned in his brother, Theodore Kaczynski, the
convicted Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   The film, to be made in conjunction with Walt Disney Motion
Picture Group, will focus on Schenectady residents David Kaczynski
and his wife, Linda Patrik. They will be consultants on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Guber Stephen, executive vice president of the
Avnet/Kerner Co., said the Kaczynskis would not receive
compensation for the film rights. ``Any money is going to the
victims' families,'' but she said she ``was not at liberty to say''
how much they will get.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen first approached the couple about 3 1/2 years ago and
discussions began in earnest about a year ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is in its infancy. The company, which produced
``When a Man Loves a Woman'' and ``Up Close and Personal,'' must
first hire a script writer.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``too soon to tell'' who will play David and Linda, and
when the film is likely to be in theaters, Stephen said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski, a reclusive former mathematics professor
whose manifestoes harped against technology, was sentenced in 1998
to life without parole for a series of bombings that killed three
people and wounded 22 others. His reign of terror lasted from 1978
to 1996, when he was arrested at his Montana cabin after David
Kaczynski told the authorities he suspected his brother was the
bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski is called the Unabomber because his targets included
universities and airline offices.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski pleaded guilty to avoid a trial at which his lawyer
had planned to offer an insanity defense, but the guilty plea also
saved him from being sentenced to death.
