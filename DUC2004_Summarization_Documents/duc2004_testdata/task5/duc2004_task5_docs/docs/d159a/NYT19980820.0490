UNABOMBER'S BROTHER RECEIVES $1 MILLION REWARD FROM JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   David Kaczynski and his wife have been given a $1 million reward
from the Justice Department for turning in David's older brother,
Theodore, as the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, an upstate New York social worker, has said
that he would give the proceeds of the reward to families of those
killed and injured in his brother's 16 bombings over 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski told the FBI in 1995 that he suspected that his
brother was responsible for the attacks after he read a 35,000-word
tract from the bomber that was published in The Washington Post.
The manifesto, which was published with joint financing from The
New York Times, echoed many of the anti-technology sentiments he
had heard his brother express.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his brother's arrest in April 1996, David Kaczynski
has said that he did not go to the FBI out of interest in the
reward, which was offered in October 1993, but out of concern that
more people could be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski killed three men and injured 29 other people
_ a human cross-section that included university professors,
corporate executives, a secretary, a security guard and 12
passengers on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and I respect their loss and wish to do whatever we
can to ease their grief,'' Kaczynski said last fall, referring to
his mother, Wanda, who lives near the couple in the Schenectady
area. ``I know that mere money cannot compensate for the loss of a
loved one or rebuild a shattered life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he did not return calls left at Equinox, the shelter
for troubled teen-agers where he works. But Anthony Bisceglie, his
lawyer, said that he expected Kaczynski to stick to his plan to
distribute the reward money, after taxes, among the victims and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has made his intentions clear in the past and I expect
he will stick with those intentions,'' said Bisceglie, who received
the $1 million check at his Washington law office Wednesday. ``The
family will not personally profit from any funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisceglie, who served as the initial liaison between David
Kaczynski and the FBI, said he immediately forwarded the check to
Kaczynski and his wife, Linda Patrik, who had conferred and jointly
approached Bisceglie to denounce Kaczynski. The couple is expected
to receive the check Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics have not been worked out'' for distributing the
money, the lawyer said. He added that federal and state taxes could
gobble up almost half of the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski has always said that he was emotionally torn by
turning in his brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the Unabom trial earlier this year,
David Kaczynski battled hard to save his brother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wanted a death sentence for Theodore Kaczynski,
while he refused to accept a defense based on mental incapacity
that could have gotten a life sentence. Last January, as trial was
about to begin, prosecutors agreed to recognize Theodore
Kaczynski's mental illness, to allow him to plead guilty to 13 of
the Unabom crimes, including the three fatal bombings, and to not
seek the death penalty. In May, he received four life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearings in a Sacramento, Calif., courthouse
Theodore Kaczynski never acknowledged his brother's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that Ted will someday forgive me,'' Kaczynski said.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, said the reward
was ``one of the largest, if not the largest, rewards in history''
in a domestic case. David Kaczynski ``ended a 20-year-plus crime
spree,'' Russell said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the short-lived trial in Sacramento, the victims and the
survivors of the victims met for the first time and bonded into a
close-knit group.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, two bomb victims did not return telephone
messages. Connie Murray, whose husband, Gilbert, was the
Unabomber's last victim, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the media, she is aware that David received the award
money, but she is not making any comment,'' said Mindi Russell, a
law enforcement chaplain, who talked to Mrs. Murray. Murray was
killed on April 24, 1995, when he opened a package at his office at
the California Forestry Association, where he was the president.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, David Bischel, the new president of the industry
association, praised David Kaczynski's offer to distribute the
reward money among his brother's victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``His offer to split the reward among the victims was gracious,
and I think reflected his true concern for the families and the
destruction that was wrought by his brother,'' said Bischel, who
attended some of the court proceedings. ``It showed a lot of
strength. The decisions he made in turning his brother in were very
difficult. He did the right thing, and he should be commended for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading the Unabomber manifesto, David Kaczynski combed
through old letters written by his older brother, a former
mathematics professor at the University of California at Berkeley
who had become a hermit in the mountains of western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   He confided his doubts to his mother and to his wife, a
philosophy professor at Union College in Schenectady. Burdened by a
terrible truth, but fearing that more innocent people could be
hurt, he denounced his brother to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone we love went over the edge _ or so it seems,'' he said
later. ``The horror is with us now, and I very much doubt that it
will ever leave us completely.''
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors dropped their bid for a death penalty, David
Kaczynski, told an interviewer with visible relief: ``It feels to
me like the weight of the world has gone off my shoulders.''
