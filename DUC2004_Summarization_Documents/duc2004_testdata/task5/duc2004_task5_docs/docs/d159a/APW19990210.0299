<HEADLINE> Kaczynski Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski believes  
he was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty and has hired a new 
lawyer to help him win a second trial, a Vermont law professor said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A new trial could lead to the death penalty for the  
anti-technology terrorist, who has been in a federal prison in 
Florence, Colo., since he was sentenced to life without parole last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important to me that Ted have a choice, the  
meaningful choice of going back to court,'' said Vermont Law School 
Professor Michael Mello, who has exchanged about 130 letters with 
Kaczynski since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mello said he is trying to talk Kaczynski out of filing a motion  
for a new trial because of the risk of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski's guilty plea cut short his trial in Sacramento,  
Calif. He capitulated after his lawyers attempted against his 
wishes to portray him as mentally ill and the judge refused to let 
him represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea bargain, the government withdrew its demand for  
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski began writing to Mello after the professor published  
articles critical of the defense lawyers. Mello contends that 
Kaczynski's guilty plea was involuntary, that he was coerced by his 
lawyers and that the judge was wrong in not letting Kaczynski 
represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski asked Mello's help in finding a new lawyer, and  
Richard Bonnie of the University of Virginia law school recently 
agreed to take the case, said Mello, who is writing a book about 
the Unabomber trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the leading national experts on law and  
psychiatry,'' Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quin Denvir, Kaczynski's attorney at the trial, and Bonnie  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence between the Kaczynski and Mello is described  
in the National Law Journal this month.
