<HEADLINE> Deputy President's Mother Closes Shop After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- If you don't have an
idea of the ubiquity of crime in South Africa, ask the
81-year-old mother of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
She closed her half-century-old store in Eastern Cape on
Thursday after an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
"I want to close this store because my life is at risk and I
do not want to die violently," a sad Epainette Mbeki said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill store at Sofuthe village, which was two years
older than Thabo Mbeki, helped sustain the whole family during
the apartheid era when the father, Govan Mbeki, was in detention
and the four children, Thabo, Linda, Jama and Moeletsi, had to be
clothed, fed and educated.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for closing my store is a fair excuse, especially
(at) my age. I have managed to make a living and support my
children's education from the store when their father was
detained in 1960," Epainette said.
</P>
<P>
The store was robbed of an undisclosed amount of money on
Sunday. A policeman was seriously injured in a follow-up
operation in a forest near the home, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Epainette was confronted by the armed men, but they fled when she
called her family.
</P>
<P>
In another scare on Wednesday, her grandson Lindisipho Potelwa
said he was sure one of the three suspected robbers returned to
the store.
</P>
<P>
"Because I was here on Sunday and have vivid identities of the
robbers, I saw one of them here yesterday pretending to be buying
some sweets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Epainette said her decision won support from Thabo Mbeki and
his wife Zanele.
</P>
<P>
Zanele rushed to be with her mother-in-law immediately after
she heard the news of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki is expected to succeed Nelson Mandela as president
of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at its mid-December
national congress and looks set to be next state president of
South Africa in 1999.
