<HEADLINE> Mandela, Mbeki Disagree on Crime: NP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- It emerged that South
African President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
did not agree on the nature and extent of the crime situation in
the country, new National Party (NP) leader Marthinus van
Schalkwyk said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki stated last Friday that crime was an extremely urgent
problem and that there was indeed an increase in some serious
crimes, The Citizen newspaper today quoted van Schalkwyk as
saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's 81-year-old mother had to close her store in Eastern
Cape Thursday after an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old store, two years older than Thabo Mbeki,
helped maintain the whole family in the apartheid years when
Thabo Mbeki's father, Govan, was in jail.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, on the other hand, reacting to a letter which van
Schalkwyk sent to him last week, said that crime was under
control and that huge success was being achieved in the fight,
the NP leader said.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk described the government's handling of the crime
situation as "extremely inept", creating the impression that it
was falling over its own feet and that the left hand did not know
what the right hand was doing.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela's approach of denial did not contribute to the
finding of solutions.
</P>
<P>
He asked for "bold and corrective" steps to fight crime in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel called for a referendum on
the restoration of the death penalty to curb the wave of violent
crimes, but was severely attacked by the ruling African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape is the sole province in the hands of the
opposition National Party.
</P>
<P>
Mandela fervently opposed the reinstatement of the capital
punishment on the grounds that the white apartheid regime used
the death penalty as a tool to oppress the black majority.
