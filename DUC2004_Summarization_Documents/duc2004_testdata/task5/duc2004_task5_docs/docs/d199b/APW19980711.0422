	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Nigeria's military leaders want to
transfer power to a civilian government and are contemplating the
composition of a government of national unity, Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki said Saturday after returning from Nigeria.
	   Mbeki met with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar during his two-day trip
and, in a briefing with reporters, was upbeat about the intentions
of Nigeria's military ruler and other commanders.
	   ``We are fully convinced that a very important window of
opportunity exists in Nigeria to move the democratization process
forward,'' Mbeki said.
	   Nigeria's military recognizes that civilians should control the
government and that a civilian administration should review the
constitution and handle other important issues, Mbeki said.
	   ``Our sense was that they were very sensitive to the fact that
such a government would have to be broadly based and broadly
acceptable to the Nigerian public,'' Mbeki told a press conference.
	   Mbeki also met with opposition groups and said both they and the
government were concerned about the possibility ethnic violence,
which has erupted since the death of jailed opposition leader
Moshood Abiola last Tuesday, would increase and lead to ``the
break-up of the country.''
	   To further the talks, retired Nigerian Gen. Olesegun Obasanjo,
who ruled Nigeria in the late 1970s and tried to steer Nigeria
toward a democratic path, will visit South Africa next Friday,
Mbeki said.
	   The deputy president's high-profile trip was important in
establishing the diplomatic credentials of the man who is expected
to become South Africa's next president in the 1999 elections.
Mbeki has already taken over most day-to-day management of the
government from President Nelson Mandela, who turns 80 this month
and will retire.
	   Mandela said Wednesday that South Africa is willing to help
resolve the crisis in Nigeria, but that any solution would have to
come from Nigerian leaders themselves.
