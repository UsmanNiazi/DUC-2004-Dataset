   JOHANNESBURG _ The ballroom, in one of Johannesburg's poshest
hotels, sparkled. A glittering crowd had assembled. It was late
1998, and South Africa's deputy president was launching a book of
his collected speeches. The patron who had financed publication
rose to introduce the author, and said, ``The most frequent
question I am asked is, `Who is this Thabo Mbeki?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki took the podium.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a student at Sussex University, he said, trying to
woo ``those lovely English female students,'' the response was
always the same: `` `But Thabo, we don't know you.' This even
though I had been in the same class as them for the past two years.
You see, this is a persisting problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, barring an upset at the polls that no one predicts,
Mbeki will step out of Nelson Mandela's shadow and become South
Africa's second post-apartheid president. But as much as Mandela is
known and loved, Mbeki is unknown, and sometimes feared.
</P>
<P>
   Observers hail him as the right man at the right time, a leader
as attuned to South Africa's social crisis as Mandela was to its
racial hatreds. Opponents regard him as a shrewd backroom operator
who tolerates no dissent. His confidants volunteer nothing, and
even those further removed choose their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a the perception that he is ruthless, but it is based
on a lot of speculation,'' said Mac Maharaj, who has worked with
Mbeki both in exile and in government. ``Mbeki is an extremely
passionate Africanist, in the continental rather than racial sense.
He is also very much a realist about the world in which we live. He
understands the global economy and the need to change the rules of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki is a formidable intellect, a carefully nurtured son
of the African National Congress, now the ruling party after
decades of fighting to bring down apartheid, a man who finds in
ancient Roman prose and modern poetry the soul of his renaissance
visions. His entire life has been a patient and painful understudy
for the office that now awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the barren Transkei village of Mbewuleni in 1942, the
second of four children, Mbeki had an early political education.
His parents were both teachers, which gave him rare access to
books, and he read voraciously. They were also communists, whose
sense of family and identity was based less on flesh and blood than
hard work and commitment to the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's mother ran a general store that also served as the
village post office. Since most people were illiterate, Thabo and
his siblings were called upon to read letters and write down the
dictated replies. From these the young boy learned the heavy toll
migrant labor takes on families whose men were drawn off to the
gold and mineral mines in distant Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood was brief. Mbeki's father left to find work in distant
cities when he was 10 years old; Thabo and his older sister were
sent to different, faraway schools the same year. The family would
never reunite. By the time he was 20, Mbeki's student political
activities caught the apartheid state's watchful eye, and the ANC
sent him into exile for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the course of Mbeki's life, even decisions about
whom and when he could wed, would be dictated by the ANC. He earned
two degrees, the latter a masters in economics, at Sussex
University in Britain, where he also developed a taste for John
Keats and Immanuel Kant. He received military training in Russia.
He then served in various diplomatic and political posts for the
ANC in London, Nigeria, Swaziland, and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's life on the front lines of the struggle placed him in
constant danger of assassination by the apartheid government.
``Thabo comes from the engine room of the antiapartheid movement,''
said Shadrack Gutto, a human rights professor at the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who knew Mbeki in exile. ``He spent
decades in hostile conditions, living on the front line when the
enemy was kicking very hard. People had to demand loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Mbeki fled into exile, his father was sentenced to
life in prison on Robben Island, along with Mandela and others
convicted of treason by the government. Before the Pretoria regime
lifted its ban on the ANC in 1990 and Mbeki could return to South
Africa, both his son, born when Thabo was just 16, and youngest
brother had disappeared while trying to make their own way to
safety in exile. They are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The personal price the Mbekis paid for their commitment was
evident on a rainy spring day in 1989 at the airport in Lusaka,
Zambia. Mbeki stood in row with his comrades on the tarmac watching
a group of aging men descend the steps of an aircraft. Among the
arrivals was Govan, Mbeki's father. It had been almost 30 years
since father and son had seen each other. ``As Thabo remained in
place, Govan . . . slowly went down the line of the official
welcoming party until he came to his son,'' wrote Adrian Hadland
and Jovial Rantao, two South African journalists, in their recent
book, ``The Life and Times of Thabo Mbeki.'' ``They shook hands and
hugged each other briefly. Govan then carried on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mbeki remains an unknown to many, the leadership
transition from Mandela won't be abrupt: It has been underway since
1995. As deputy president, Mbeki has been the administrative chief
behind Mandela's ceremonial presidency, running the Cabinet and
writing every speech his boss has delivered in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's inauguration will usher in a new phase in South African
politics. Mandela focused on reconciling the races through
forgiveness and a common understanding of the past. Mbeki, in a
speech before the National Assembly last May, expressed a radically
different view.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on ``the material conditions in our society which
have divided our country into two nations, the one black and the
other white,'' and said: ``What this throws up, inevitably, is the
question: `Are the relatively rich, who as a result of an apartheid
definition are white, prepared to underwrite the upliftment of the
poor, who as a result of an apartheid definition are black?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The ``two nations'' question frames the agenda Mbeki will
pursue. To avert instability, he will have to make good on promises
to improve the lives of the poor. As an economist, he understands
the need for careful management of the public purse. Two years ago,
he was the driving force behind a shift in Mandela's economic
policy from ambitious social spending to fiscal restraint. What the
government can't provide, he has argued, those who benefited from
apartheid must.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has entered a new phase where the warm, fuzzy edges
have come off,'' said Steven Friedman, director of the Center for
Policy Studies in Johannesburg, describing the tone Mbeki has begun
to set.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely described an enigmatic mix of charm and cunning. In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, he played a crucial,
behind-the-scenes role in negotiations to end white power. He met
early Afrikaner emissaries sent to feel out the ANC in exile, and
charmed them with his pipe smoke and erudition. Back in South
Africa, he soothed the fears of right-wing whites and Zulu
nationalists who threatened to boycott the first all-race elections
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys personal connections across the South African
landscape, from corporate boardrooms to the rural meeting houses of
traditional leaders. He also has international ties that Mandela
lacked, cultivated during his decades in exile and his term as
deputy president. Vice President Al Gore is one of his closest
overseas friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki is sensitive to criticism and combative with the
press. Under Mandela, he has already made moves to strengthen the
presidency and centralize control.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki set off alarms last October by leading an attempt, against
Mandela's wishes, to block the final report of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which investigated the abuses of the
apartheid era for more than two years. Mbeki objected to the
panel's conclusion that the liberation movement as well as the
white government had been guilty of gross human rights violations,
saying the ANC's conduct during the struggle cannot be weighed in
the same scale as the apartheid state's.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and others again criticized Mbeki this
week, when he proposed legislation to exonerate the ANC and other
liberation groups.
</P>
<P>
   As he steps out from the background, crowds gather daily to
greet him in township stadiums across South Africa. After five
years of talk about reconciliation, the impoverished masses want
what has not yet come: houses, better schools, and above all, jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the job the ANC prepared him for. Mbeka is married but has
no living children; his work is his life. He lacks Mandela's human
touch, but policy is the measure of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mbeki is stepping in at a favorable moment,'' said Mahmoud
Mamdani, a professor at the University of Cape Town. ``He is
stepping into a situation that will make the maximum use of his
talents.''
