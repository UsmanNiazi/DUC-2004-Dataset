THABO MBEKI, THE JOHN ADAMS OF SOUTH AFRICA  
(DW)

   CAPE TOWN _ As Winnie Madikizela-Mandela shouted recently to a
cheering crowd in a black township: ``I'm sick and tired of
white-controlled media who say they don't know Thabo Mbeki. Who
cares?''
</P>
<P>
   President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, whose speeches usually have
vaguely threatening undertones, was unsubtly pointing out that when
Mbeki takes over as president on June 16, he will govern with a
huge mandate whether whites or anyone else know him or not.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that means they need be afraid. Given the sorry history
of democracy in Africa, South Africans may someday count themselves
lucky that their second post-apartheid president is someone who has
no military background, is an able administrator and repeatedly
pledges himself to democracy and to fighting corruption even in his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   His government, Mbeki said in his victory speech Thursday, will
``approach the exercise of power without any arrogance, with
humility.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nelson Mandela is the George Washington of this new
democracy, the kind of giant among men who turns down offers to be
king, then Mbeki is its John Adams. Like Adams, he is small,
sharply intelligent, visionary, reflective, sometimes tart-tongued,
and an adept back-room fighter.
</P>
<P>
   He is also, on any occasion, the man most likely to turn up too
formally dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on their difference in raiment, the dapper Mbeki, 56,
has mused publicly on his resentment of people who constantly ask
whether he can fill Mandela's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I wear those big, ugly things?'' he said. ``Or,''
he added with a shudder, ``those shirts'' _ meaning the bold
``Madiba shirts'' that Mandela adopted after a trip to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki intends to fit his own smaller but more meticulously
polished footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Born on June 18, 1942, Thabo Mbeki grew up in poverty in
Mbewuleni village in the Idutywa area of the Transkei _ the
historic land of the Xhosa.
</P>
<P>
   Though he grew up on the side of the valley with the rural
peasantry who wore blankets and painted their faces with red clay,
Mbeki was the son of radical party intellectuals who ran a small
store and taught school to survive.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the liberation struggle virtually from the age of 10,
when he and a cousin sold Coke bottles to raise money to pay their
African National Congress membership fees. The struggle eventually
cost him a son, a brother and, two biographers say, any real
relationship with his father, who was one of its heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Govan Mbeki, spent much of his life in jail and sent
his children to relatives very young so they couldn't come to
depend on parents who expected to be arrested. The elder Mbeki,
whose wife still lives in Idutywa, now lives in a bungalow on the
grounds of his son's official mansion, but ``seems sad, lonely and
regretful,'' with ``little familial warmth either in the
relationship or even in Thabo's achievements,'' according to a new
biography, ``The Life and Times of Thabo Mbeki'' (Adrian Hadland &AMP;
Jovial Rantao, Zebra Press, April 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki dislikes revealing too much about himself. His
pre-campaign book ``Africa, the Time Has Come,'' is just a
collection of speeches, with a dry 22-page biographical sketch.
</P>
<P>
   But even the speeches reveal a great deal. His 1964 statement to
a U.N. committee in London, delivered when he was a 21-year-old
student asking it to prevent the Pretoria government from hanging
his father, is an ennobling portrait of the elder Mbeki, touching
in its combination of humility and righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   His 1978 speech ``The Historical Injustice'' shows a piercing
intellectualism as he subjects the history of South Africa to
Marxian analysis, skewering the British imperialists and the Boer
pioneers for corrupting even the capitalism and Calvinism they
preached, regressing into feudalism, a racist version of
Lutheranism and simple murder and theft because it was easier and
more profitable than adopting the liberalizing trends of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer poetic power, his ``I Am an African'' speech,
celebrating the new Constitution in 1996, surpasses even the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which it
somewhat resembles _ although King was a more riveting speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He is becoming better known because biographers are probing his
past; the fact that he fathered a child at 16 who disappeared 17
years later, probably at the hands of the police, has humanized him
a bit. So have photos of him as a young man leaning affectionately
against friends or smiling at his 1974 London wedding to Zanele
Dlamini, who was studying social work and now heads a bank for
rural women.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is now seen as a politician, but he is really a lifelong
intellectual guerrilla, rather than an armed one. At Lovedale
Institution, a South African boarding school, he excelled at Latin,
mathematics and science, but was expelled in his senior year for
leading a student strike. A white teacher who spotted his erudition
arranged for a scholarship to the University of Sussex in England;
but he began school late because he had been arrested by the
Rhodesian government while trying to slip out to Britain without a
passport.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a degree in economics and backing causes from
nuclear disarmament to getting the United States out of Vietnam, he
was sent by Oliver Tambo, the London-based president of the African
National Congress, to set up offices in Zambia, Botswana, Swaziland
and Mozambique, making the white South African government feel
surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of the public faces of the dissident group,
meeting reporters and accompanying Tambo on diplomatic trips to
Moscow, Washington and other capitals. In the 1980s, when white
executives and prominent Afrikaners defied their government to meet
the African National Congress in exile, Mbeki was always there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after the ANC was legalized, he returned home for the
first time in 28 years. While the spotlight briefly lingered on
Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader who negotiated the new
Constitution, Mbeki returned to his role as heir apparent with his
election as ANC chairman in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of him, particularly asserted among whites, is that he
prefers back-room victories to open debate and puts ``Africanism''
above equality. Those fears got new fuel this week when Business
Day, a financial paper, reported that he had intervened to stop
Judge Edwin Cameron, one of the country's best legal minds, from
being named to the highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting ``judges and lawyers close to the process,'' the paper
said he persuaded Mandela to choose an ``able and solid'' black
candidate because there are only three nonwhites on the 11-seat
Constitutional Court. Mbeki's legal adviser denied that he did more
than consult, but that was regarded with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview with the newspaper The Sowetan, Mbeki
made no bones about his ``Africanist'' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are talking about poverty alleviation and eradication,
then necessarily you will focus on people who are poorest,'' he
said. ``If that is what is mean by Africanist, you cannot avoid
it.''
