GEORGIA SENATOR UNDERGOES BRAIN SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a top Senate
Republican leader, underwent brain surgery for a cerebral
hemorrhage Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which relieved pressure caused by the bleeding,
was performed by Dr. Gary Gropper at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta,
Coverdell's hometown. Gropper described the two-hour procedure as a
success but said it was still unclear whether the 61-year-old
senator would experience any lasting effects from the hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is in serious condition and will remain in the
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over the next 48 hours we'll have a better idea how
he's doing,'' Gropper said at a hospital news conference where he
was joined by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon who is a
close friend of Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell arrived at the hospital on Saturday evening after
severe headaches. Tests found the hemorrhage, in his temporal lobe,
and doctors ordered the surgery Monday after his condition
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman, Nina Montanaro, said Coverdell did not
lose consciousness or suffer any seizures that she knew of before
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The industrious and self-effacing Coverdell was elected to the
Senate in 1992 and quickly climbed the ranks of the Republican
leadership. He is secretary of the Republican conference, No. 4
among the leadership, and a confidant of the majority leader, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi. Before coming to Capitol Hill, he was a
longtime minority leader of the Georgia Senate, chairman of the
Georgia Republican Party and director of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell serves as Senate liaison to Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumed Republican presidential nominee, and had spent the last
few weeks preparing for the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia.
