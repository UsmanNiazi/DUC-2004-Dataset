<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul Coverdell, a former director of the Peace Corps
and Georgia's senior U.S. senator, died Tuesday of complications
resulting from a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was pronounced dead at Piedmont Hospital at 6:10
p.m., 29 hours after undergoing emergency surgery to stop bleeding
in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's wife, Nancy, other family members and Senate
Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie were at his side. His death was quiet,
according to a brief statement issued by his Senate office in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), a close friend,
announced Coverdell's death to the Senate at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is breaking,'' Lott said from the Senate floor. As
Lott stared at the podium, his voice cracked as he struggled to
compose his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has been a close friend and confidant, an outstanding
member of this Senate, and we will miss him greatly,'' Lott said.
``I just want to say to Nancy Coverdell and to the family that we
extend our sympathy and our love.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott then offered a resolution of the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas the Honorable Paul Coverdell served Georgia and the
United States Senate with devotion and distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas the Honorable Paul Coverdell served all the people in
the United States as director of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas his efforts on behalf of Georgians and all Americans
earned him the esteem and high regard of all his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And whereas his untimely death has deprived his state and the
nation of an outstanding lawmaker and public servant, now therefore
be it resolved that the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and
deep regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable Paul
Coverdell, a senator for the state of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the Democrats, Sen. Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.)
called Coverdell ``a man of peace who did so much in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known him so well, and miss him so much, and can only
share the thought that he rest in peace,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Said President Clinton: ``Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime
serving the people of Georgia and our country. He was a tireless
advocate who worked to ensure that all children have access to
quality education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in a state of shock,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald
(R-Ill.). ``He was with us last week. .. And then today, they
discovered he had no brain activity. So I guess the best way to
describe the state of the Senate is a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's funeral arrangements had not been made public
Tuesday. Lott said the Senate will set aside time this week for
other senators to express appreciation for their colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Gov. Roy Barnes has the legal authority to name
a successor pending a special election Nov. 7, but he is not
required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who held the No. 5 position in the Republican
leadership and served on the Senate Finance Committee, was known
for his intense work ethic and self-effacing demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1992, Coverdell was a blur of motion in the Senate,
moving from important committee deliberations to the Senate floor
for votes and back to his office for appointments.
</P>
<P>
   He became a leader in fashioning an education policy for
congressional Republicans, creating what he called ``A Plus''
accounts that permitted parents to set aside earnings in tax-free
education accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Peace Corps under President Bush and as an
Army veteran in the Far East, Coverdell developed a keen interest
in foreign affairs and became an expert on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   He cast his last Senate vote Friday, to repeal estate taxes, an
issue at the top of his domestic legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was highly regarded by Republicans and Democrats
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has not one enemy,'' said Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho).
</P>
<P>
   Tributes and expressions of sorrow poured in from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a friend of Coverdell's for more
than 20 years, called Coverdell's death a ``huge loss for his
family, his friends, his constituents in Georgia and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by
all of us who knew him and loved him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson called
Coverdell a common-sense conservative who ``will be remembered as
an ardent defender of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Nicholson joined Senate Republicans in a
prayer for their colleague. Nicholson recalled how when he became
chairman of the RNC three years ago, Coverdell was the first person
to ``put his arms around me and say, 'We're going to get some
things done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said Coverdell's abrupt illness reminded them of
how suddenly tenuous life can become, especially for someone such
as Coverdell, who was among the most vigorous members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all recognized ... how fragile life really is
and that we better value every day that we have an opportunity to
be at full speed,'' said Craig. ``But we tend not to think about
that until one of these circumstances happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell had been complaining of headaches off and on for
several weeks before being rushed to the hospital Saturday night
with severe pain.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors operated for two hours Monday after his condition
worsened and he experienced a massive hemorrhage inside his brain.
</P>
<P>
   The hemorrhage resulted in uncontrollable swelling, according to
the hospital, causing pressure on areas of the brain regulating
consciousness, breathing, pulse and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is survived by his mother and wife. The couple had no
children.
