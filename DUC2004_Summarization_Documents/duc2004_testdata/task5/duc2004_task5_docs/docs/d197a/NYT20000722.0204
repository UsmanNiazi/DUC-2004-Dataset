<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell was eulogized Saturday as
a humble public servant who became a political giant through
selfless dedication and quiet civility.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who died Tuesday of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 61,
was memorialized at Peachtree Road United Methodist Church before
being interred at an undisclosed location. His remains were
cremated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people attended the public service, which attracted
a diverse array of national and local political figures. Scores of
current and former staffers of Coverdell's Washington and Georgia
offices also attended, wearing blue ribbons on their lapels.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, who will name a successor to Coverdell,
delivered one of the four eulogies. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) spoke
on behalf of the Senate. Clyde Rodbell, a longtime personal friend,
spoke about Coverdell's code of personal integrity and his warmth,
and expressed sorrow over the senator's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul, your visit was just too damn short,'' said Rodbell, his
voice quivering with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend and political associate Fred Cooper concluded
with a eulogy to Coverdell, written by former President Bush, that
will appear in the upcoming issue of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one good example of politics' being a noble calling,''
said Cooper, quoting the elder Bush. ``We Bushes loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, attended the
service and sat just behind Coverdell's widow, Nancy. He was the
only current or former elected official who sat with Coverdell's
family _ his sister, mother and scores of cousins, aunts and
uncles.
</P>
<P>
   For the length of the 67-minute service, politicians of every
persuasion and party sat together silently, laying aside their
differences to pay tribute to a man regarded as the Senate's
leading mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who disagreed with
Coverdell sharply over policy, sat between Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the conservative firebrand,
sat next to former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat. Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who fought Coverdell vigorously over federal
education policy, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was there, along with
nearly 100 current and former members of Congress and their
spouses, most of whom flew in Saturday from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Zell Miller, mentioned as a successor to Coverdell,
attended with his wife, Shirley, along with former Gov. Lester
Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coverdell was cremated, there was no casket inside the
sanctuary. A large portrait, showing a smiling Coverdell standing
next to an American flag, stood in front of the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a lifelong Democrat, said Coverdell became his teacher
in the state Senate when Barnes was first elected in 1974, even
though Coverdell was from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the strongest Republican I ever met, but he never let
politics get in the way . . . of friendships,'' said Barnes, who
lost his composure several times during his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   What separated Coverdell from the partisan politics of the day,
Barnes said, was that ``you could trust Paul Coverdell.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the two breakfasted regularly and told each other
the most intimate political secrets. Barnes said he even discussed
his gubernatorial bid with Coverdell, and never feared Coverdell
would betray his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's legacy, Barnes said, was one of actions and deeds,
not words and glory; friendship and trust, not cynicism and
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye, old friend,'' said Barnes, crying softly. ``See you
in a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who spoke before Barnes, praised Coverdell's humility,
iron will and unblemished character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just knew Paul Coverdell, he was one of your best
friends,'' said Gramm. ``He was the kind of man your mama wanted
you to grow up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter moment, Gramm also recalled Coverdell's ``squeaky
voice,'' disheveled brown hair and flailing arms as he raced around
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell, who spoke first, said he nicknamed his longtime friend
``Senator Careful'' because of his scrupulous integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell said Coverdell once refused his offer to install two new
air conditioning units in his home at cost. Rodbell then offered to
sell them to Coverdell at dealer's cost and donate the profit to
charity. Coverdell agreed.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Rodbell said, the two were out to dinner
and an unknown patron sent over a bottle of wine. Coverdell found
the waiter and sent it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul, he didn't send it to you,'' Rodbell said he told
Coverdell. ``He sent it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peering over his glasses, Coverdell looked at him and said,
``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, Nancy Coverdell, who gazed for long moments
at her husband's portrait, did not speak. Rodbell praised her quiet
inner strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the epitome of grace under fire,'' Rodbell said to the
stoic widow, embracing her after his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Coverdell selected the choral music for the service, which
opened with ``Song of Peace'' by Vincent Perischetti and concluded
with an a cappella version of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,''
sung by Navy Cmdr. Robert Baird.
