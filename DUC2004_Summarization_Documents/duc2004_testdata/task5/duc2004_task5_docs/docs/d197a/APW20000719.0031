<HEADLINE> Georgia Sen. Coverdell Dies at 61  </HEADLINE>

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell's death came at the height of
his quick rise to Republican leadership, just days before a
national convention that was to bear the imprint of his tireless
work in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Georgia politician died Tuesday of a stroke. He was
61.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who had reported no serious health problems in the
past, was hospitalized Saturday after complaining of severe
headaches. He had surgery Monday to relieve pressure from a
cerebral hemorrhage but died from swelling in the brain, Piedmont
Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell was one of the kindest and most decent men I
met in my entire life,'' said former President Bush, who appointed
Coverdell director of the Peace Corps in 1989, a position he held
until 1991. ''We shall miss him as we would miss our own son.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell signed on early as the Senate liaison to Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential campaign and was busy days before his
death preparing for the Republican National Convention, which
begins in Philadelphia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by
all of us who knew him and loved him,'' the younger Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was first elected to the Senate in 1992 by defeating
incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler Jr. He became the fourth-leading
Republican in the Senate, serving as GOP Conference secretary and
sitting on several committees, including agriculture, finance and
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell built a reputation as an effective, behind-the-scenes
operative for Senate Republicans, working long hours to organize
his colleagues into a unified voice.
</P>
<P>
   He was a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
affectionately called him ''Mikey,'' handing unglamorous tasks or
pointed media questions to Coverdell. Aides said the reference came
from the 1970s TV commercial in which a boy named Mikey agrees to
try Life cereal after his friends won't.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who announced Coverdell's death in the Senate, expressed
his sympathy to Coverdell's widow, Nancy, his sole survivor. The
couple had no children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hearts break also,'' Lott said, his voice choked with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's signature issue for the past four years was
education, specifically his proposal to expand higher education
savings accounts to allow tax-free withdrawals for school expenses
from kindergarten through high school.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed the measure in 1998, and forced
Republicans to pull it from a year-end budget bill in 1997 under
threat of a veto. The president maintained that the measure would
hurt public schools and benefit only wealthy families. Coverdell
had been pushing the legislation again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was one of Clinton's most outspoken critics in the
Senate, both on domestic and foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Clinton honored Coverdell ''for
his years of service as a solider, a public servant, and a
statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime serving the people of Georgia
and our country,'' Clinton said. ''He was a tireless advocate who
worked to ensure that all children have access to quality
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich were the
architects of the modern Republican Party in Georgia. During 16
years in the Georgia Senate, Coverdell was the best known GOP
office holder in a state that was dominated by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   His party-building efforts paid off in 1998, when Coverdell
became the first Republican to win re-election to the Senate from
Georgia since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was born Jan. 20, 1939, in Des Moines, Iowa, and
received a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1961 from the
University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   He served two years in the Army in Okinawa, Korea and Taiwan
before helping his parents start their Atlanta insurance and
financial services business, Coverdell &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, has the option of appointing a
successor to serve until a special election in November. The last
senator to die in office was Rhode Island Republican John Chafee,
who died from heart failure last October.
