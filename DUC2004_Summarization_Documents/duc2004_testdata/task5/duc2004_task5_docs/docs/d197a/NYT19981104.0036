 &HT;    Coverdell beats back challenge from Coles

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell cruised to re-election
Tuesday, defeating Democrat Michael Coles and Libertarian Bert
Loftman in a one-sided contest that was largely overshadowed by the
race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell became the first incumbent to retain that Senate seat
since Democrat Herman Talmadge in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell made his victory speech at 10:15 pm after CNN
projected him the winner. He stressed the need to reform the tax
system, upgrade education and gear up the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture also needs Washington's special attention, he added.
Coverdell said his recent campaigning in Georgia underscored to him
how much farmers have been suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cornerstone of our national security is our ability to feed
our people, our troops and our allies,'' Coverdell said in his
speech at the Sheraton Colony Square.
</P>
<P>
   Coles didn't immediately concede and withheld comment until more
complete results were available from metro Atlanta precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 9 p.m., when he was trailing by more than 10
percentage points, Coles declared to supporters that he was
confident he would still pull out a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed Coverdell
dominating Coles by better than 2-1 among white voters. But Coles
ran neck and neck with Coverdell among women and held a slight edge
among voters under the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who did not identify themselves as religious right
favored Coles, according to exit poll results.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, a former insurance executive, served in the state
Legislature before being appointed by President Bush to head the
Peace Corps. He upset Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During his first term in the Senate, Coverdell emerged as a
behind-the-scenes workhorse for the Republican leadership,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss).
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell initially ran a low-key campaign around the slogan
``Coverdell Works.'' As Coles began airing commercials that
attacked his votes on health care and veterans, Coverdell went on
the offensive with charges that Coles planned to cut Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, the founder of The Great American Cookie Co., contributed
nearly $3 million from his own self-made fortune to fund his race
when Democratic contributors shied away. Coles raised about $1
million from contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Coles tried to seize the initiative in the race in July by
inviting President Clinton to a fund-raiser in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But after Clinton was forced to disclose his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, Coles was put on the defensive for accepting the
president's support.
</P>
<P>
   In his television commercials, Coles aired health care horror
stories to emphasize his differences with Coverdell over patients'
rights to sue their HMOs or health insurers. Coles favored
expanding those rights, while Coverdell did not.
</P>
<P>
   Coles also hammered Coverdell for his votes on veterans's
issues, pointing to a crucial procedural vote in July that cleared
the way for cutting $15.5 billion in health care benefits for
veterans with smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Loftman, who campaigned on the need to abolish the IRS and
replace the federal income tax with a federal sales tax, could not
overcome his lack of name recognition.
