 &HT;    Coverdell to join Bush's presidential committee

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell, Georgia's senior Republican,
flies to Texas Sunday to formally accept an elite position on the
presidential exploratory committee of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican and son of former President George Bush has
also tapped Coverdell to be his point man in the Senate, where
Coverdell has served since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious first order of business is to nurture and secure
as much support in this institution as possible,'' Coverdell said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Coverdell to be one of the 10 members on his
presidential exploratory committee, the first formal step in his
bid to win the 2000 presidential nomination, is hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell supported each of President Bush's campaigns for
president, including his first run in 1980 when he lost out to
Ronald Reagan. In 1989, Bush named Coverdell, then a state senator,
to be his Peace Corps director. Coverdell's visibility in that role
was one factor that helped him win election to the U.S. Senate in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been associated with this really grand family for a
long time,'' said Coverdell, who was re-elected to a second term
last year. In 1996, Coverdell backed the failed presidential bid of
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has already jumped to an early lead in the polls over
a crowded field of Republican presidential aspirants, has scheduled
a 2 p.m. Sunday news conference in Austin to announce all the
members of his exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Though by no means the flashiest of those who are likely to
rally around the Texas governor, Coverdell will bring formidable
political skills to Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is one of the Republican Party's most methodical and
aggressive fund raisers and he is widely respected in Washington
for his relentless commitment to the GOP mainstays of tax reduction
and smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the senior senator from Georgia, Paul will be a potent
force, not only in Georgia but in other states as well,'' said
Georgia Republican Party chairman Rusty Paul, who will assume a
major role in the presidential campaign of publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also has established himself as a leader in GOP
education policy. Last year, he authored a proposal for tax free
savings accounts for education that won the backing of the
Republican Party. It passed Congress but was vetoed by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he expected Bush to run a presidential campaign
that was different from that of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is distinctly a Texan, a southerner,'' Coverdell said.
``His dad was sort of a transplant, but not this kid. He's a
southerner. His campaign will be distinctly G.W.''
