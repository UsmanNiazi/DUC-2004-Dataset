   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), an early opponent of
the U.S. bombing campaign in Kosovo, emerged from a meeting with
President Clinton Tuesday saying he expects Congress to quickly
adopt a massive emergency spending bill to fund the operation
through October.
</P>
<P>
   That ``should be a signal to the nation and our adversaries that
no one over here is thinking short term,'' said Coverdell, a member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he expects the cost of the operation to be at
least $2 billion and as much as $4 billion. ``I think the number
will be larger rather than smaller,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress back in session after the two-week Easter recess,
the Clinton administration waged a full-court press among members
of Congress to head off any sudden groundswell of opposition to the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was one of about 60 lawmakers who met with Clinton
privately at the White House. Secretary of Defense William Cohen
and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, scurried
between briefings on Capitol Hill, laying out the impact of the
bombing campaign to caucus meetings of both Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The outreach appeared to be effective. The president and his
advisors asked for more time to let the bombing campaign to inflict
damage on Serbia and bring the Slavic nation to the negotiating
table. Coverdell, for one, said he was willing to give it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better than I have anytime up to now,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) attended one of the briefings and
emerged saying he was more opposed than ever to the use of U.S.
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't anointed or appointed to carve up Kosovo,'' Cleland
said. ``I'm heavily opposed to the use of ground troops at all.''
