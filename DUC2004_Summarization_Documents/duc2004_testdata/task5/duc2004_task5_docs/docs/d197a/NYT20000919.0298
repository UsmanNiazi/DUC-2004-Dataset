   WASHINGTON _ Tuesday was a day for remembering Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning memorial service, members of the Peace Corps
praised their former leader as a gentleman who believed education
was key to helping developing countries. The late Republican
senator from Georgia headed the agency from 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, four senators, including Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.),
met for the first time Tuesday morning to discuss plans for
building monuments to Coverdell in Washington and in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell died on July 18 following surgery after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour program at Peace Corps headquarters drew several
people from Georgia, including Nancy Coverdell, the senator's
widow; Reps. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, both Georgia
Republicans; and Miller, appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes to serve in
Coverdell's place until the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers lauded Coverdell for bringing more women into the
management ranks of the agency, initiating Peace Corps programs in
Zimbabwe and Mongolia, expanding programs in Central and Eastern
Europe after the Cold War, and reopening programs in troubled
places such as Haiti, Nicaragua and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Olsen, Peace Corps chief of staff under Coverdell, recalled
the words of the Polish deputy minister of education, one year
after Coverdell had promised and sent 100 English teachers to the
country. The minister addressed a Peace Corps meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ```He kept his word, and in doing so, he gave me courage when I
had none,''' Olsen recalled the minister saying.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at Tuesday's event also praised Coverdell's creation of
the program World Wise Schools, in which Peace Corps volunteers
share their experiences with U.S. schoolchildren, helping the
youngsters understand other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers announced the agency also will name a new, annual
award in Coverdell's name. The Paul Coverdell Award for Excellence
in Education will go to three educators who best embody the values
of international education and cross-cultural understanding in the
World Wise Schools program.
</P>
<P>
   ``His deep and abiding commitment to Peace Corps volunteers and
to the history, values and traditions of this extraordinary
organization stands as a model for all of us to follow, and it is
one that we will never forget,'' Peace Corps director Mark
Schneider told the audience of about 200.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a statement, praising Coverdell for
pioneering work that fostered better global understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as he recognized the benefits Peace Corps volunteers
brought to the countries they served, he also believed that the
greatest benefits would be felt here at home _ in the understanding
that stretches across barriers of language and geography, that is
felt through the letters sent home, the photos shared, the
experiences remembered,'' the president wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been planning such a memorial since Coverdell's
death, but Tuesday was the first day that Congress members, Nancy
Coverdell and others who wanted to attend were available to take
part, said Eileen Cassidy, Peace Corps press director.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Coverdell monuments, plans are in the very
preliminary stages, but one item the committee members discussed is
the possibility of erecting memorials in Georgia and in the
nation's capital, Miller said. The other committee members are
Sens. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Mike DeWine
(R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the group decides, it will be up to Nancy Coverdell to
give final approval, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss said the funds for the monuments would most likely
come from a mix of private and public funds.
