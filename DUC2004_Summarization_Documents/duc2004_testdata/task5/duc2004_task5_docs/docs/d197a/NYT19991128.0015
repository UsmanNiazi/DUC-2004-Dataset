 &HT;    Coverdell serving as guiding hand to Bush camp

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Early this year, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) met
privately in a hotel here with members of Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential team.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down the list of 55 Republican senators, Coverdell
identified at least five and maybe as many as nine who he knew were
already supporting the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) became the 27th senator
to endorse Bush. The campaign is sitting on eight more endorsements
to roll out soon, and Coverdell is aggressively courting four or
five more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this could get to 40,'' said Coverdell. Not bad for a
body that counts two of its members, Sens. John McCain of Arizona
and Orrin Hatch of Utah, among the list of GOP presidential
aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   The strong support for Bush in the Senate is probably the most
tangible evidence of what Coverdell has managed to accomplish for
Bush since being named to the governor's presidential exploratory
committee in March.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, Coverdell also has worked tirelessly to
help Bush fashion his positions on issues. Coverdell has also made
sure that Bush understands the dynamics of Republican politics on
Capitol Hill and has served as his early warning sentinel on such
controversial issues as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Coverdell has emerged as one of Bush's most
dependable advisers. He says he talks to Bush's campaign regularly
and to the candidate himself about every other month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have endeavored to ensure that they have a knowledge of
various legislative initiatives that are occurring here,'' said
Coverdell. ``If there is a question that arises _ `What's this
mean?' or `Is this a good way to deal with the subject?' _ we have
people who can respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush become the 43rd president, Coverdell is poised to
become an influential player at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a real entree into the Oval office,'' says
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas). ``The governor obviously
hasn't focused as much on national issues. Paul has given him a lot
of issues input, and he's just very respected by the Bush campaign
and in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's Texas colleague, Sen. Phil Gramm, agrees: ``He will
almost certainly become George Bush's principal spokesman in the
Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Coverdell is a conduit between the Bush
campaign and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's contentious debate over the nuclear test ban
treaty, for example, Coverdell immediately alerted the Bush
campaign that 20 of the 29 senators who were publicly or privately
backing the governor opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush eventually announced his opposition to the treaty as well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Coverdell defended Bush after the governor offended
some Republicans in Congress by criticizing GOP efforts to save
money by deferring earned income tax credit payments to the working
poor.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush later announced his support for teacher testing, a
concept that many congressional Republicans oppose, Coverdell
sought to smooth things over again. Coverdell assured his
colleagues that Bush was not in favor of federally imposed teacher
testing, but preferred leaving it up to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has worked very hard to bring a strong coalition of
support for Governor Bush,'' says Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).
``He's a good behind-the-scenes person. Because he's quiet about
it, I don't think people recognize what a tremendous role he
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's relationship with Bush dates to 1988 when both men
worked to help elect former President Bush, Bush's father. But
Coverdell's relationship with the Bush family dates to 1978, when
Coverdell first met the senior Bush when the latter was serving as
United Nations ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, then a Georgia state senator, became an early
supporter of Bush's bid to win the GOP presidential nomination in
1980, the year Ronald Reagan won and made Bush his running mate. In
1989, when Bush was president, he appointed Coverdell to head the
Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The national exposure Coverdell received in that position helped
fuel his upset win over former Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell has maintained his close relationship with President
Bush. In fact, the guest cottage at Bush's family retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, is jokingly referred to as ``Coverdell
Cottage,'' says Karl Rove, Gov. Bush's top strategist in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's a big-picture thinker,'' says Rove. ``He's a guy that
sees not the detail but the broader, bigger picture in which issues
fit. That's an unusual talent for someone. He's very soft-spoken
and very plain-spoken and absolutely dependable. I get this very
strong sense that his colleagues think if Paul says it, he means
it. And that's powerful.''
