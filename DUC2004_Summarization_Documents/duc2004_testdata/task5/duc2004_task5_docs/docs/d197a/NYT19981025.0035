 &HT;    Coverdell moves to Senate center of power

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hours after casting his last vote of the 105th
Congress Wednesday, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) strode through a
crowd of 300 supporters in the Marietta town square and headed
straight for the big stage erected in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   A momentary cheer surged from the crowd as Coverdell, without
pausing to shake any hands, mounted the platform, festooned with
his campaign slogan ``Coverdell Works'' and packed with local
Republican office holders and the day's featured speaker, former
Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   State school board Chairman Johnny Isakson, who served with
Coverdell in the state Senate in the 1970s, introduced his former
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I were Republicans when being Republicans wasn't
cool,'' Isakson told the crowd. ``Paul puts on his resume that he
was minority leader of the Georgia state Senate, but there weren't
but five of us, so it wasn't very hard. In fact, every Republican
had a job because there were more titles than there were jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed for Coverdell. After nearly 30
years in politics, the wiry Republican is at the peak of his
political powers. In less than six years, Coverdell has watched his
party become the majority party in the U.S. Senate; he has gone
from Georgia's junior senator to its senior senator; and he has
moved from the relative of obscurity of a first-term senator to the
center of the Southern Republican leadership that controls
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On this cloudy Wednesday in the GOP stronghold of Cobb County,
Coverdell breezed through his stump speech in less than 10 minutes,
hitting his voter-friendly campaign themes of passing education tax
breaks and renewing the war on drugs without once mentioning his
opponent, Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Coverdell's 1992 campaign was striking. Then,
Coverdell campaigned as the Washington outsider, a ``change agent''
as he called himself, vowing to reform Congress and relentlessly
attacking the voting record of his incumbent opponent, Wyche
Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's pledge of lower taxes and less government was spiced
with a reformist plan to slash contributions from special interest
political action committees, end perks and automatic pay raises in
Congress and put Congress on a six-month work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell forced Fowler, the top vote getter, into a general
election runoff and went on to win by a tiny margin.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as he campaigns for a second six-year term, Coverdell
is every bit the incumbent Washington politician, more firmly
entrenched in the formal party power structure than any Georgia
senator since Richard Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is the fifth-ranking member of the Senate leadership
and a close confidant of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.). He is second in line to succeed Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And
he has built a presence in the Senate that earns nothing but praise
from his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen senators come and go and ... he has established
himself as quickly as any senator as I've ever known,'' said
Quayle. ``He just works hard. He doesn't take no for an answer.
He's smart. He's steeped in policy. He knows more than other
senators, and in the Senate knowledge is power.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, of course, always flatter, particularly around
elections. But Coverdell's work ethic is repeatedly cited by
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a person who is very splashy about telling people
about (what he's done),'' said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas). ``One of
the reasons he is in the leadership is that he is so low key when
it comes to claiming credit. As a result, people like to put Paul
in leadership positions because he makes other people look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 59, embodies an odd mixture of political skill. At
just 5-feet-9-inches tall, he hardly fills the room. He is an
uninspiring speaker who frequently steps on his words in such a way
as to make former President Bush, who was notorious for mangled
rhetoric, seem the essence of lucid delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd tactician, he nonetheless is uncomfortable with much of
the back-slapping and glad-handing that goes with the office.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's appearance in Cobb County was typical. After the
event, Coverdell remained on stage as voters who had come to hear
him _ many for the first time _ strained to shake his hand from
four feet below where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   He exited the stage quickly, pausing just long enough to
exchange hellos and shake hands with a white-haired veteran who
attempted to draw him into conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism that he doesn't linger enough is one that
Coverdell says he has heard repeatedly. He responds with an example
drawn from his nearly three years in the Peace Corps, where he was
director under Bush before joining the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to show the flag in three countries than spend 10
days in one country,'' Coverdell said. ``It's better to be present,
even if you are not present as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his worker bee style may also explain why Coverdell has
struggled to make a lasting impression on Georgia voters since his
election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Several voters at Wednesday's rally said they couldn't name
anything that Coverdell had done in office and would be voting for
him simply because he was a Republican like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be doing something, so that's why we are here,''
said Denise Bartlett, who brought her young children to the rally.
``I like the fact that he is a conservative. We vote
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Coverdell spoke the Republican core values of lower
taxes and less spending, but also campaigned hard on his record as
a moderate state senator from Fulton County, highlighting his
support for open meetings laws, ethics legislation and
environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He also campaigned as a pro-abortion rights candidate who said
that if the Supreme Court ever overturned Roe v. Wade, the historic
case deciding a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion,
``I would support reconstituting Roe v. Wade by legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Coverdell quickly established a voting record
that was among the most conservative in the Senate. Although he
maintains that he is still pro-abortion rights, the National
Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) scores Coverdell a zero on
abortion issues, while the conservative Christian Coalition gives
him a 100 percent ranking on their pro-family agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell voted against allowing military personnel to use their
own money for abortions in U.S. military hospitals and against
imposing criminal penalties on people who block access to abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not pro-choice,'' said NARAL political director
Gloria Totten.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell opposed the bi-partisan effort to reform the nation's
campaign finance laws that was championed by his friend, Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), although he says he still supports a reduction in
the maximum PAC contribution limit from $5,000 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   On environmental issues, Coverdell has a lifetime ranking from
the League of Conservation Voters of 6 percent, although he voted
to strengthen drinking water laws in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremist, and his voting record is out of step with
mainstream, working families,'' said David Worley, chairman of the
Georgia Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell rejects the notion that he has become more
conservative in office, but he acknowledges that the political
environments in Washington and Georgia are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The divisions in Georgia in those days were rural-urban,''
Coverdell said. ``I was an urban (state) senator. In Washington,
they are philosophical. They are left of center, right of center,
more conservative or liberal. It's a different call. You are in a
very different setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said that he hasn't lost his reformist zeal. He noted
that since going to Washington, he has returned $1 million to the
government in unused office expenses _ half of it from his refusal
to exploit Congressional franking privileges for mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Coverdell voted against a cost-of-living increase for
members. But the measure passed anyway, and Coverdell accepted the
$3,000 raise beginning this year. He now earns $136,673, in
addition to about $135,000 he receives from his family business in
a special arrangement negotiated with the Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to a possible second term, Coverdell said he will
continue to push his proposal for tax-free savings accounts for
education, which President Clinton vetoed this year, and winning
the war on drugs. In general, however, he said he doesn't spend too
much time looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to focus on the work of the day, rather than always
having your mind focused somewhere else,'' Coverdell said. ``Just
do the best you can with the day you were given. I do tend to
function that way.''
